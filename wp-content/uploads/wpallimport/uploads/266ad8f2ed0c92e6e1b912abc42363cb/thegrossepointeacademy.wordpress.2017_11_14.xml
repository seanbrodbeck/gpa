		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>When Shaka Bahadu was three years old, his parents took him to a local preschool to be tested for admission. Unfortunately, the toddler was not accepted. "I was supposed to put together a puzzle but I refused," Shaka explains nearly twenty years later. "I?m not exactly sure why. I guess I wasn?t in the mood at the moment."</P><P>A friend steered Shaka?s parents in the direction of the Academy, where either Shaka was in a better mood during his admissions test or Molly McDermott, the admissions director, saw beyond the recalcitrance of a three-year-old to Shaka?s immense potential. Shaka began his GPA odyssey in the Early School and ended as student council president his eighth grade year. He became interested in student government in fourth grade and served as a student representative every year until his eighth grade year, when he ran for the office of president.<BR>In addition to student government, Shaka was very active in athletics at the Academy, participating in soccer, basketball and tennis every year during middle school. He performed well academically, although he describes himself as "a late bloomer." When he was in third grade, his mother passed away, and Shaka went through a rough two years. "I didn?t pull myself out of it until about half way through fifth grade," he recalls, ?but the teachers were very understanding. I could talk to them about how I felt and they were totally cool with it."</P><P>Shaka went on to University Liggett School for high school, where he felt "tremendously prepared. I walked into Liggett and got into every advanced and honors class I could get into. I really wanted to continue the work ethic I had learned at the Academy. I worked hard, and when I got to high school I kept going. I wanted to continue everything I had done at the Academy."</P><P>When it came time to apply to college, Shaka originally had his sights set on Stanford. Harvard "was supposed to be a long shot," he says. When he got in, it was a tough decision. Ultimately he decided on Harvard. "You don?t say no to the big ?H?!" he jokes. Harvard also offered him a financial aid package he couldn?t refuse. As far as his college experience is concerned, Shaka says "it was rough at first, but it was exactly where I needed to be. I?ve learned how to think independently, which is the most important part.? While at Harvard, Shaka was elected First Class Marshal of the Class of 2004, which essentially makes him class president for life. He majored in Biological Anthropology, studying the evolution of human nature, and, as a pre-med student, took a heavy load of science courses. This latter has aptly prepared him for his current endeavor. Upon graduating, Shaka signed up for Teacher America, a non-profit organization that selects recent college graduates to teach at inner city schools where they are most needed.</P><P>"Science was by far my favorite class at the Academy," Shaka says. "Now I am teaching eighth grade science to inner city youth in Miami." Shaka truly believes in the mission of Teacher America, which is "for every child to have the opportunity to receive an excellent education. The concept behind it is to give emerging leaders of this country - future politicians, business people, lawyers and doctors - practical experience in our educational system to see where the flaws and benefits are, so that one day when we are in the position to make changes, we can."</P><P>Following this two-year commitment, Shaka plans to apply to medical school, where he will continue the educational experience that began at the Academy Early School. Says Shaka: "The Academy prepared me academically, socially, emotionally, and mentally. It was by far the best educational experience I?ve had so far - including Harvard." </P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P align=left><IMG hspace=5 src="http://198.63.59.144/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050824145957.jpg" align=left border=0>To go away to boarding school for her freshman year of high school was Emily Liggett's choice. It was a difficult and scary decision, but not one she has regretted, not even during those occasional moments of homesickness. Up until last year, her only experiences away from home were trips to Black River Camp and going on the Academy Adventures camping trip to central Ohio the summer after her fifth grade year at the Academy.<BR></P><P align=left>"The first week was a blast," Emily says of her freshman year at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. "And then the work came."</P><P align=left>While she found the first trimester very difficult, she got her "act together in the second trimester," she reports. "I remembered what I had learned at the Academy, the techniques for studying. These really helped me organize my thoughts."</P><P align=left>Clearly these techniques - along with hard work - have paid off. She finished her third trimester with a 3.8 grade point average. And in spite of a rigorous year of core classes required of freshmen at Lawrenceville, she still found time for extracurricular activities. For example, she joined the tennis team in the fall, played basketball in the winter, and ran track in the spring. She also worked backstage for plays and joined a number of clubs, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Lighthouse, both student organized Christian clubs. In addition, she was involved in the Young Republicans' Club (although she admits her interest in debating members of the Young Democrats' Club waned a bit after the election), and helped raise money to send to third world countries as part of Operation Smile - an organization that helps pay for operations for children born with cleft palates.</P><P align=left>Emily was used to being busy and active while she was at the Academy, too, in spite of ambitious academic standards she set for herself. She not only consistently received High Honors while in middle school, but she maintained over a 4.0 grade point average throughout her middle school career. On the athletic front, she was the #1 singles tennis player for two years, and played varsity basketball for three years and varsity volleyball for two years. "I loved the volleyball season!" she says, in particular the mentor program, in which varsity players work with JV players on such skills as bumping and spiking. Favorite experiences at the Academy include the Washington, D.C. trip in fourth grade. "It was the best trip I ever went on," she says. "It really opened my eyes to the world."</P><P align=left>All of Emily's former teachers at the Academy would be proud of the confident, poised young woman she has become. With a summer spent rejuvenating at home, traveling with her family and at camp with her two sisters, she is ready for the challenges of her second year away. She looks forward to expanding core course offerings and taking ceramics in the winter term and a class on the Bible in the spring. She also looks forward to participating in some of the school's traditions for sophomores, such as getting a big sister. She herself will be a big sister for real to her own younger sister, Marjorie ('05), who will be joining her at Lawrenceville this fall.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Caitlin Munn '03 is, by her own admission, a shy person. It is not easy for her to talk about her accomplishments as a sophomore at University Liggett School or the successes of those formative years that began when she was a preschooler at The Grosse Pointe Academy. However, she does credit the Academy with helping her overcome her shyness at critical times. For example, says Caitlin: "Being in the eighth grade play really helped me feel more comfortable in front of a crowd." She also recalls having to present her eighth grade heritage project in front of her classmates.</P><P>Other experiences at the Academy also helped Caitlin come out of her shell, meet people and make friends. For example, she went on three Academy Adventures trips with Mike Fultz during the summertime. "Those trips were a lot of fun," she recalls. "They taught you a lot about working together, teamwork and independence."</P><P>Caitlin's years at the Academy gave her the confidence to pursue the toughest schedule and course load possible at ULS. In addition to such advanced classes as Spanish III Honors (her favorite class), Honors Algebra II Trigonometry, and Honors Chemistry, she is required to play three sports. She opted to play field hockey in the fall and ice hockey in the winter, and is conditioning for the spring season.</P><P>While at GPA, Caitlin played #3 doubles tennis and played on the varsity volleyball team in both seventh and eighth grade, and was instrumental in helping the team continue its winning streak over two seasons.</P><P>&nbsp;"Caitlin had a serve we called the 'Munnster,'" says her former coach, Mike Fultz. While on the varsity team she won awards for most improved overall, most improved digger, and most improved server. Her eighth grade year she was the starting first server, and ended the season with the highest serving percent (95.74) and the most aces. In addition to holding a number of all-time records, Caitlin was, according to Mr. Fultz, "one of our best all-time servers."</P><P>This summer Caitlin plans to return to the Academy for her third consecutive year as a counselor at Blue Streak Camp. She was among 350 high school students invited to participate in the National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine. If she decides to go, she will be sent to one of the participating hospitals and have the opportunity to shadow a doctor. She is interested in pursuing a career in medicine, and volunteers four hours every Sunday at St. John Hospital, where she fulfills a number of tasks - from holding newborns to reading to children to pushing a candy cart around to the nurses' stations.</P><P>Caitlin's advice to this year's graduates is to "get involved and take advantage of things that Middle School doesn't offer, such as different sports and clubs. This is a great way to meet people and make new friends." To younger students who still have a few years ahead of them at the Academy, Caitlin points out that: "Teachers at the Academy give a lot of advice. Follow that advice. They give it for a reason. Work hard and challenge yourself as much as possible, because it will pay off."</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>"My pursuit of higher education unquestionably began at the Academy," says Steve Stanton '94, who is now in his second year at the University of Michigan working towards a Ph.D. in Psychology.</P><P>Steve came to The Grosse Pointe Academy as a first grader. "I was an only child and my parents wanted to give me a good start," he explains. "They looked at a variety of schools in the Grosse Pointe area. I think one thing that impressed them was the long period of tenure so many of the faculty members had. All the teachers were very established and my parents were impressed with their dedication. Many of them were at the Academy for their entire careers. This was something my parents grew to appreciate."</P><P>Steve developed strong relationships with many of his teachers during his eight years at the Academy and recalls some of his fondest memories, like beating then Headmaster Sid DuPont in golf by one stroke when he was in eighth grade ("I still have the score card," Steve says. "I considered it one of my greatest accomplishments of my young life!") and racing honors math teacher Scott Tily in completing a quiz.</P><P>Steve still keeps in touch with many of his teachers. During a recent visit, he planned a holiday dinner with Marion Chrisner, who was not only his music teacher for eight years, but also gave him private piano lessons. He also helps out with Mike Fultz's Academy Adventures summer trips whenever possible. "I didn't go on the trips when I was a student," Steve admits, "but I have more than made up for it with the number of trips I have gone on since!"</P><P>Steve refers to Mr. Fultz as "a good cheerleader in all aspects. He gets kids enthusiastic not just about science, but about sports and his outdoor trips as well." Steve enjoyed six years of science with Mr. Fultz, culminating with sixth grade biology.</P><P>&nbsp;"The Academy is incredibly good at fostering interest in academics," Steve affirms. "I am in a field now that is firmly rooted in science, and it all started in sixth grade biology and eighth grade honors chemistry."</P><P>Steve believes that his teachers "fostered the idea that it's okay to be pushed hard, and that when you are pushed and do well, it's all the more rewarding. Learning to be pushed to that extreme has carried over into the rest of my educational experience as well."</P><P>Upon graduating from the Academy, Steve went on to attend Grosse Pointe South High School. "I can say with certainty that when you graduate from the Academy, you are prepared for high school," Steve says. In fact, while the honors classes at South were challenging, particularly in the upper grades, "it was nothing like the challenges I faced at the Academy." He went on to attend the University of Michigan, where he received a B.A. in Psychology and Economics.</P><P>&nbsp;"The Academy is a wonderful place to get eight plus years of being nurtured academically but in a way that really cultivates a desire to challenge yourself," says Steve. "I can vouch for myself and other people I know from my class and other grades that it is something that really does last."</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>When we opened the school doors on Wednesday morning we did so with all the enthusiasm that is associated with a new school year. We also began the year with heavy hearts as we grieve for the people of New Orleans, Louisiana, the surrounding communities and the gulf coast from Gulf Shores, Mississippi to the Florida border.</P><P>As a former resident of New Orleans, my family has a special connection to that community. Our son Judd was born there in Baptist Hospital, a hospital on Napoleon Avenue that today is under eight feet of water. As we watch this drama unfold, we pray for the safety of the people, the future of the region and our nation itself.</P><P>All of those associated with the Academy will be organizing our efforts to help the survivors of this tragedy. As with 9/11 and the tsunami, we will respond with open hearts and minds to support relief efforts.</P><P>There are over 5,000 people from the devastated area coming to Detroit. They will need housing, food, jobs and schools for their children. My family has contacted the United Way and Neighborhood Service Organization (800-241-4949) and has offered to house a family.</P><P>The Academy will be working to raise funds for the Red Cross. I urge all of you to help in any way you can.</P><P>On Monday, September 12 at 8:45 a.m., we will commemorate the events of 9/11 on the front circle of the main school building. At that time we will also pray for the people affected by the hurricane. Shortly, we will also announce plans for contributing to the Red Cross.</P><P>Please join us on September 12 and in our efforts to restore the stricken area and provide hope for the future.</P><P><STRONG>Phil Demartini<BR></STRONG>Head of School</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Faculty Profile: Wendy Jewett</title>
		<link>http://www.gpacademy.org/news/new-faculty-profile-wendy-jewett/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Wendy Jewett has faced some challenging moments in her life. She has taught high school science in an inner city school in Minneapolis, where poverty was a harsh reality and the only recourse was one's own innovation and ingenuity. She has jumped out of airplanes during her training at Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. (She describes the experience as "absolutely terrifying" and jokes that it will come in handy this year when she is teaching laws of motion and gravity to her seventh grade science students. "I have definitely tested the limits of gravity!" she says.)</P><P>However, Wendy herself would probably describe one of her most scary moments as coming back to the school she graduated from in 1987 and having to address some of her former teachers - now colleagues - by their first names.</P><P>Wendy attended the Academy from first through eighth grade. During that time, she had Mrs. Wolney in third grade, Mr. Fultz for biology, Mr. Tily for computers and math, Mrs. Johnson for social studies, Mrs. Chrisner for music, and Mrs. Ream for math and science. Karen Ream retired last June after 26 years of teaching at the Academy, and it is filling her shoes that Wendy finds the most daunting challenge of all.</P><P>"I feel so blessed to be back at the Academy," says Wendy. "My daughter and I moved back here [from Minnesota] to be with my family, and now we have the Academy family too. I have to keep pinching myself. But what grounds me - and reminds me that I better keep working on those lesson plans - is knowing the shoes I am filling. That is a sobering thought. But it is a wonderful opportunity, too."</P><P>Wendy is well positioned to face the challenge. She comes to the Academy equipped with seven years of experience teaching high school science, three years in North Carolina and four years in Minnesota. She received a Bachelor of Science in Genetics and Cell Biology from the University of Minnesota School of Biological Science, and has dual teaching licenses in life science and chemistry. She prides herself on creating a classroom atmosphere that is motivating and positive. She is an advocate of using technology in the classroom to enhance learning and promoting scientific inquiry and problem solving through experimentation.</P><P>In other words, Wendy jokes, "We'll drop things out the window and blow some stuff up."</P><P>In all seriousness, she has made creative use of the mirrored panels in a storage cabinet in her classroom to include the class agenda for the week. For the first day of school the panels were filled with such inspirational quotes as the following one by Allen Bloom: "Education is the movement from darkness to light."</P><P>In addition to being an alumna of the school, Wendy is also the parent of a first grader, Ellie, who is in Kelly Beke's class. "I must be the first Academy triple crown!" she says. "I'm an alum, a teacher and a parent, all at the same time!" Ellie is adjusting well to the transition to a new school, but she misses her friends in Minnesota and especially her father, a captain and medical service commander of the largest deployed medical unit in Iraq.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"With all these changes in her life," says Wendy, "what softer place to land than here."</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Remarks by <STRONG>Phil Demartini</STRONG>, Head of School<BR>September 12, 2006</P><P>Welcome to all of you on this beautiful morning.</P><P>We are here today to commemorate the events of September 11 and pay our respects to the victims of that dreadful day. Normally, our flag is raised to its rightful and highest position and we proceed with the program. However, this year, because of the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Katrina, we have placed the flag at half-mast as requested by President Bush. We will also take time to pray for the survivors of that horrible occurrence.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050923122634.jpg" border=0></P><P>Throughout its history, the United States has been put through very serious challenges and always has survived. There have been wars, serious illnesses like polio and tuberculosis, terrible accidents and dangerous storms - none, however, as devastating as Hurricane Katrina. I imagine it will take decades for the Gulf Coast to recover. I imagine it might be impossible for the victims to ever fully recover. It is our task and obligation as American citizens to help wherever and whenever we can. We at the Academy - faculty, students, administrators and staff - will do our part to help heal the survivors and give them a future of hope. Our plans will be announced in the near future. As part of the Academy Family, we will ask all of you to help us reach all of our goals. Together, along with millions of other citizens, we will take what has become America's greatest tragedy and turn it into America's greatest show of compassion. President Bush has declared that Friday, September 16 be a day of recognition and prayer for the hurricane victims. We will observe this in each classroom.</P><P>I would like all of us to have two moments of silence: one for the 9/11 victims and survivors, and another for the victims and survivors of Hurricane Katrina.</P><P>Thank you - We are all so proud to be Americans, and we are so proud of our wonderful country.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The curricular school-wide theme for the year is "Set Sail with the Power of Math!" Throughout the year we will host a variety of activities to promote math and all of its powers. On March 8, 2006, we will have a Math Fair that is similar to the Art Fair of last year. Each student will have several math projects or samples on display. During the day of the Fair, the author/illustrator David Schwartz will host small presentations for the students, and that evening he will host a larger presentation for students and parents. He has written many books that celebrate math, including How Much is a Million, If You Made a Million, If You Hopped Like a Frog, and many more. We are very excited about his visit!</P><P>We are also excited that students in grades 2-8 will be participating in the Continental Math League. This League is a national competition that involves several "meets" per year (the number of meets depends on the grade level). A meet is a thirty-minute time period in which each student independently attempts to solve six word problems. Each correct answer is worth one point; the top six scores are submitted to the League as a GPA team score. Students prepare for these meets during portions of math class. Some classes solve a problem a day. Others work on several of the problems at one time. The League provides over one hundred practice problems. Each student's problem sheets will become part of his or her math portfolio.</P><P>We participate in the Continental Math League for a variety of reasons: 1) students' problem solving capabilities improve; 2) students learn many different problem solving strategies; 3) students are motivated to achieve; and 4) we are able to compare our results with over 400 schools from around the country.</P><P>If you have any questions about this article, please contact Wendy Demartini, Curriculum Coordinator, at <A href="mailto:wdemartini@gpacademy.org">wdemartini@gpacademy.org</A> or call 313-886-1221.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Collecting Leaves: A Sixth Grade Science Project</title>
		<link>http://www.gpacademy.org/news/collecting-leaves-a-sixth-grade-science-project/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>"Every year I am asked by kids, 'Why do we have to do this?'" says science teacher Michael Fultz of the sixth grade leaf project, a well-known staple of his science curriculum. "They want to know why it's important to be able to identify all of the trees on campus. I tell them that trees are the most dominant organism around them. Step outside - there are trees all around you. You should be able to identify them."</P><P><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050923150317.jpg" align=left border=0>Mike also believes that the leaf project is a great way to start off the year. "It's not abstract," he explains. "It's right in front of you. It's doing science. If you follow the key and make careful observations, you'll come to the correct conclusion. That's what this is all about - getting kids to make careful observations and to look for subtle differences in order to discover the correct answer. This is the scientific method."<BR></P><P>There are four steps to the process. The first step is learning how to use a dichotomous key and make good identifications based on the characteristics of the different trees. For example, does the plant have needle-like or scale-like leaves? Are the needles more than one centimeter long? Do they occur in bundles or in groups along the twigs?</P><P>The second step is identifying and collecting leaves. The students preserve their leaves in books until they are ready to place them in a photo album. Once this step is completed, they will have collected and learned to identify 41 different types of trees on the school property.</P><P>"There are even more trees on campus," Mike says, "but many of them are exotic and the kids will never see them again. I concentrate on the more common trees they will see everywhere." The students learn some interesting facts about the trees along the way. For example, they learn that bowling alleys are made out of sugar maple. Baseball bats are made from ash, because it is lightweight and strong, and absorbs shock well. Hardwood floors are often made out of oak, and furniture may be made out of woods like cherry, maple and walnut.</P><P>In identifying the trees, the students will use terms like "opposite simple" and "alternate simple" and look for such characteristics as the color, lobes and teeth of the leaves and the texture, color or peel of the bark. For example, the bark on a locust peels sideways, and what Mike calls "the give-away" to identifying a white cedar is that it is the only tree on campus with tiny scales rather than needles. An astute observer trained to use several of his or her senses might also comment that the scales smell like grape bubblegum.&nbsp; </P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050923150247.jpg" border=0></P><P>The students are finished collecting their leaves during the first few weeks of the fall, but their fieldwork is still not done. The next step is for them to answer the question: What is the most important tree on the school's property?</P><P>In the experiment, the importance value of the trees is based on size and number. "This is when they start to learn about the scientific method," Mike says. In order to answer this question, the students must first be able to identify the trees (a process they have of course mastered in the leaf collection phase). After measuring and counting a survey of the trees on the property, they head indoors with their compiled data - to the computer lab, to be exact. There they learn how to record their data, make graphs and charts, and write an interpretation.</P><P>"It is all part of the discovery process," Mike says. "If they take it step by step, follow the key, make good observations, and record good data, they will discover. This is what science is all about."</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Professional engineers, designers and architects routinely congregate in seminars and workshops to share best practices, conduct research, and study trends and issues as part of their continuous career improvement. The teaching vocation is no different. Those charged with educating our children also get together often for professional improvement, and school-sanctioned professional development (PD) days are an important part of that activity.

As inherent learners themselves, teachers use PD days to stay on top of trends and technology that affect the work they do with students. That is especially evident at The Grosse Pointe Academy, where a combination of on-campus and off-site PD days, seminars and classes contributes to making its faculty one of the most well-qualified and innovative teaching staffs in the state.

In fact, as GPA students enjoyed the last day of their spring break on April 6, their teachers were in the middle of another day-long PD session, one of seven days of professional development scheduled for the school during this year.

“We have one main PD day in the fall and one in the spring,” said Jennifer Kendall, the Academy’s assistant head of school for institutional advancement and early school education. “We also use three days for professional development before the students return in the fall and two after they leave at the end of the year.”

<strong>Quality of instruction</strong>

Research has proven again and again that the quality of instruction is the most important factor that parents look for when choosing a school for their children.

According to Learning Forward, a Dallas-based association advocating for educators, when parents of students are asked what they want for their children, there is overwhelming agreement that they want the best teacher possible in every classroom. “The most important factor contributing to a student’s success in school is the quality of teaching,” the organization said in a report titled “Why Professional Development Matters.” While parents may not be familiar with this research, Learning Forward says they are united in their desire to ensure great teaching for every child every day.

Claudia Leslie, a French teacher and library specialist in GPA’s Early School, is the chair of the school’s professional development committee. She said the on-campus PD events for teachers on April 6 included "a teachers ed camp, tech/STEAM presentations and a Mini-Maker Faire."

<strong>Innovation grants</strong>

Off-campus, there also is plenty of opportunity for GPA teachers to gain additional knowledge and skills.

“During the year, six of our teachers visited schools across the country to gather and share ideas,” Kendall said.

She said the Academy’s Innovation Grant program, which was largely funded by the school's auction last May, is intended to provide faculty and staff with the opportunity to visit and learn from cutting-edge programs at other independent schools across the country.

GPA Head of School Lars Kuelling said the school’s teachers are always seeking innovative ideas to make their classrooms more vibrant for their students. “We were so fortunate to have had this additional [Innovation Grant] funding to support new ways to make The Grosse Pointe Academy the best learning environment possible.”<a class="a2a_dd" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save"><img src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" alt="Share" width="106" height="16" border="0" /></a>

Erik Brynjolfsson, the author of “The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies,” says there is a disproportionate number of Montessori-educated people founding and managing many of today’s successful tech companies. Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, musician Yo Yo Ma and Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales, to name a few, he notes.

Brynjolfsson thinks it’s a direct result of the Montessori classroom environment that “emphasizes self-directed learning, hands-on engagement with a wide variety of materials (including plants and animals),” typically occurring in a very deliberate sensorial school day.

Add Wall Street Journal blogger Peter Sims — who says, “the Montessori educational approach might be the surest route to joining the creative elite,” — to the many, many proponents of a education philosophy that is centered in nurturing the uniqueness of each developing child.

Interested parents found out recently about these advantages when The Grosse Pointe Academy held its annual Montessori Information Night on November 11 on the Academy’s campus in Grosse Pointe Farms.

During the session, parents observed demonstrations from Academy Early School teachers highlighting the Montessori method's child-centered, individualized approach to education, specifically geared for children 2-1/2 to 5 years old. The event detailed the areas of the classroom, learning experiences, and benefits of the Montessori program for those interested in enrolling their children in Michigan’s longest continuously operating Montessori program.

		<title>Another class heads to high school with the Academy ‘advantage’</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>GPA's newest graduates will be attending some of the finest secondary schools in the country, including Deerfield Academy, University Liggett, Cranbrook, Choate Rosemary Hall and the International Academy.</strong>

<strong>Alum tells newest graduates that the Academy gave them "gifts that will carry you throughout your life; gifts that will get you through difficult and challenging experiences."</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-grads_BD4A9954f_edit_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25929"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25929" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2016-grads_BD4A9954f_edit_1200px.jpg" alt="2016 grads_BD4A9954f_edit_1200px" width="1200" height="863" /></a>

When commencement speaker and Academy alum Megan Bonanni told the newest class of graduates from The Grosse Pointe Academy last evening that among the many pieces of advice they will get before heading to high school, one of the most important is to “be kind,” it may have been met with a little bit of nonchalance from those on the stage.

“But,” Bonanni said, “the truth is when you live a life where you are kind, like-minded people will come to you.”

It was simple, yet powerful advice.

She told them that high school can be tricky. “It’s awkward. New high school students are trying to figure out who they are and frankly they are very emotional,” she said. “So be kind and surround yourself with like-minded people who lift you up instead of tearing you down.”

[caption id="attachment_25930" align="alignright" width="350"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bonanni_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25930"><img class="wp-image-25930 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/bonanni_350px.jpg" alt="bonanni_350px" width="350" height="489" /></a> Commencement speaker Megan Bonanni, who graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1980, is a partner at Pitt McGehee Palmer &amp; Rivers PC, a Royal Oak, Mich., firm specializing in employment law, civil rights, personal injury and criminal defense.[/caption]

Bonanni, who graduated from GPA in 1980 and currently is a partner at Pitt McGehee Palmer &amp; Rivers PC, a Royal Oak, Mich., firm specializing in employment law, civil rights, personal injury and criminal defense, spoke to the class and their family and friends as part of the Academy’s 2016 commencement ceremony, which was held Tuesday evening in the school’s Tracy Fieldhouse.

Head of School Lars Kuelling also addressed the new graduates, who now journey to high school with arguably a very distinct advantage over most other eighth graders in the area — “the Academy advantage” is what school officials typically say.

“Graduates, you have learned a great deal while at GPA, and now we ask that you take that knowledge and use it for the good,” Kuelling said. “You are more than ready for the challenges and responsibilities of high school, and we know that, but we will miss you nonetheless.”

Kuelling also told the grads that they have accomplished much as a class. “You’ve distinguished yourselves in the classroom and the arts, on the athletic field and in community service – and you have been the best big buddies that our first graders could have hoped for,” he said.

“In the process, your teachers and I have seen that there’s not much that fazes you as a group. You always impress us with your camaraderie and willingness to jump right in, no matter the situation. And, that’s why the phrase ‘Hakuna Matata,’ which means ‘no worries,’ is the perfect motto for your class. You’ve learned how to enjoy life while facing challenges head on.”

Academy alum Bonanni also recounted for the 2016 grads that even though she herself went through many of the same challenges they did when she was their age, her own GPA experience was both profound and dynamic, and that even though she graduated 36 years ago, they all share in something special.

“We share gifts that this school gave to us and they are gifts that will carry you throughout your life; gifts that will get you through difficult and challenging experiences,” she said.

She mentioned two gifts in particular.

“It is here at the Academy where I was taught a love of learning. And it is here where each individual — and their uniqueness — is celebrated by teachers, by administrators.”

“The Academy always made me feel unique, special, worthy,” Bonanni told the grads. “And you will see that there is an indelible mark left on you — a mark that only comes from spending so many years in a place that promotes such inclusion, tolerance and respect for others.”

So it is without question that this year’s talented class of 29 students, who are heading to some of the finest high schools in the country — including Deerfield Academy, University Liggett, Cranbrook, Choate Rosemary Hall and the International Academy — are leaving 171 Lake Shore Road with an advantage — an advantage that comes from experiencing at least eight years of the best “uncommon” education available in southeast Michigan.

<strong>Congratulations to The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Class of 2016:</strong>

<strong>Shekinah Aho, Justin Ambris, Cesar Arreguin, Katie Bagby, Weston Brundage, Trey Chennault, Angelo Cracchiolo, Isabella Cubba, Timmy Donaldson, Megan Driver, Maria Fields, Haleigh Howard, Noah Humphries, Tierney Janovsky, Dakota Jones, Oliver Jonsson, Will Jonsson, Aiden Kuelling, Brooke Popadich, Blake Pradko, Josh Roberts, Nafi Sall, Christopher Scupholm, Sade Shaw, Ian Shogren, Emma Smith, Isabella Tomlinson, Matthew Valente and Molly Woods. </strong>

In an article written for <em>The Atlantic</em> earlier this year, educator, author, and speaker Jessica Lahey engages Wharton professor Adam Grant about identifying and cultivating original thinking in students.

Lacey, who will be the speaker for the 2016 edition of the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series on Nov. 7 at The Grosse Pointe Academy, asked Grant about the role teachers play in educating original children, and how teachers and parents alike can protect what’s special in these original children—traits that have the potential to disrupt lesson plans today, but, if nurtured and protected, may just change the world tomorrow.

In a series of videos sponsored by genConnect, a digital media company that connects real life experts with real people, Jessica Lahey, educator, author and this year’s speaker for the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series on Nov. 7 at The Grosse Pointe Academy, discusses a variety of topics about parenting school-age children.

In the first video posted below, Lahey talks about looking at where many parents go wrong with overparenting, how it affects kids, and what really good, strong, “autonomy-supportive” parenting can do for children.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>On Friday, October 7th, all first through fifth grade students will participate in The Grosse Pointe Academy's sixth annual CATCH Fun Run. The CATCH organization was founded by Sparky Anderson in 1987. CATCH stands for Caring Athletes Team for Children's and Henry Ford Hospitals. The organization provides sick children and their families with items and services that are not covered any other way.&nbsp; The following are examples:</P><UL><LI>While a child was suffering through a fatal illness, his father wished to spend as much time as possible with his son.&nbsp; To do so, he was forced to take an unpaid leave of absence from his job.&nbsp; CATCH funds were used to pay for one month's rent during the father's leave.&nbsp; <BR><LI>An 8-year-old girl with paraplegia and numerous other physical disabilities demonstrated great social skills, but was limited in her interaction with peers due to her disabilities.&nbsp; CATCH helped pay for a bike with special back support that now allows the child to play and socialize with her friends.</LI></UL><P>The Fun Run will take place here at school around the perimeter of the soccer field. The run will begin at 2:00 p.m. (Please note that this is a change in time.) We are asking each child to please donate $5. All donations should be in to your child's classroom teacher by October 5th.&nbsp; Students in first through third grade should wear their intramural uniforms to school.&nbsp; Sweatpants and sweatshirts are encouraged in case the weather is chilly. The fourth and fifth grade children will change into their PE uniforms before the event begins.</P><P>Feel free to come watch and cheer on our great student runners! For more information regarding CATCH, visit their website at <A href="http://www.catchcharity.org">www.catchcharity.org</A>.&nbsp; If you have any questions about the Fun Run, please e-mail me at <A href="mailto:sovshinsky@gpacademy.org">sovshinsky@gpacademy.org</A>.</P><P>Thanks for your support,</P><P><STRONG>Sasha Ovshinsky</STRONG></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grosse Pointe Academy fourth graders participated in the fifth annual AT&amp;T/MACUL Student Technology Showcase on September 28 at the State Capitol Building in Lansing. The students demonstrated to elected members of the Michigan State Senate and the House of Representatives how technology is being used in the classroom to facilitate learning.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050930142944.jpg" border=0></P><P>Accompanying fourth graders Gabriella Colonna, Karstan Minanov and Allison Mobley were third grade teacher Debby Wolney, Early and Lower School French teacher Claudia Leslie, and Director of Technology Robert Rochte.</P><P>The students presented projects they completed last year as part of the third grade curriculum. Last year in Mrs. Wolney's class, the students created a digital photo documentary of The Grosse Pointe Academy. Using historic maps, blueprints and pictures from GPA Archives, records provided by the Grosse Pointe Historical Society, and the publication Know Your Grosse Pointe by the League of Women Voters, they learned about The Grosse Pointe Academy of the past in order to capture some of that history using the technology of today.</P><P>The students toured the property and its building, researching all they could find out about its history. Then, each student selected an area that he or she thought was most interesting to preserve with a photograph. Using a digital camera, they photographed each other by the areas of interest. Returning to the classroom, each child wrote a factual paragraph detailing his or her photo. The research was then word processed in a Microsoft Word document.</P><P>In an interdisciplinary twist to the project, the students, with the help of their French teacher, Claudia Leslie, translated their works into French. The students displayed both versions of the journal to visitors during the MACUL conference.</P><P>"Our students represented us very well at the MACUL Technology Showcase," says Mrs. Wolney of the experience. "We were one of the very youngest groups, but our children didn't seem to be aware of that at all. They shook hands, explained in great detail about their project, and raved about their school to curious onlookers. As a result, they had their picture taken with many dignitaries."</P><P>The Student Technology Showcase is sponsored by AT&amp;T and the Michigan Association for Computer Users in Learning (MACUL), an organization dedicated to bringing educators from all levels together to share their knowledge and concerns regarding educational uses of computers and technology. </P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>What a week of community spirit it has been. It was kicked off during the second annual Academy Tailgate Party on Saturday, a marathon of fun for attendees, some of whom remained from morning till night. The children present took advantage of the soccer field for impromptu soccer and football games, while adults enjoyed a casual afternoon of football viewing and socializing.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20050930143127.jpg" border=0></P><P>Tuesday featured the first buddy event and the third annual Fall Spirit Night. First and eighth grade students had already become acquainted with their buddies last Friday during their trip to the apple orchard, but the remaining students in grades 1 through 7 got acquainted on Tuesday afternoon. They gathered around the flagpole to hear brief remarks by Phil Demartini, then paired off with their buddies to complete a "Getting to Know You" sheet. Pairings were as follows: Grade 2 with Grade 5; Grade 3 with Grade 6; and Grade 4 with Grade 7. Special thanks go to third grade teacher Jeanette Stepanek for organizing the buddy event. The next event will be held on October 21 and the theme will be Halloween.</P><P>On Tuesday evening, the community came out in full force to cheer on GPA sports teams while enjoying fun, food and friendship. Present at the event were Kensington School, who faced the boys' soccer team; and Greenhills, who matched up with the Lady Bulldogs in tennis. Competing against GPA in a cross-country meet were ULS, Greenhills and St. Joan of Arc.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The topic for math for the month of October is probability and data analysis. The middle school math team has put together three activities involving probability and will use the data collected to create graphs that can then be used for data analysis and discussion.</P><P>The activity for this week is coin flipping. Given ten flips, students are to predict (and record) how many times the coins will be heads and how many times tails. Then they are to actually flip a coin ten times and record their results. These results will be placed into a box at the math booth in the cafeteria or given to math teachers Michelle Roberts or Wendy Jewett. The middle school students will graph the data as it is collected and share the results with the school.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The new face of professional development, using technology to access quality presenters at affordable costs, has come to Academy teachers. On Wednesday, October 5, through distance learning, the entire faculty was able to hear author and educator, Rick Wormeli, talk about "Homework Practices that Really Work." This is the first of a series of six seminars for faculty through a subscription offered by the Independent Schools Association of Central States (ISACS).</P><P>Through these one hour audio conference/visual PowerPoint seminars, faculty are able to learn about current research and best practices first-hand from experts in their fields, but share the cost with dozens of Midwest independent schools. Another advantage for faculty is being able to discuss ideas presented and how to implement them since everyone is able to "attend" without travel costs. Other topics in the series include "Writing Essential Questions" and "The Role of Questioning in Teaching and Learning," presented by Grant Wiggins of Authentic Education, and&nbsp; "Differentiated Instruction," by Carol Tomlinson of the University of Virginia. Madelyn Swift will present "Discipline for Developing Responsible Students" and Robert Brooks, Harvard Medical School Psychologist, will discuss "The Power of Mindsets: Nurturing Motivation and Resilience in Students."</P><P>Teachers are able to e-mail or ask questions directly during the presentation. They may also submit evaluations for each seminar online.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Kate Kingsley has the distinction of working with the Academy's very youngest children: the two and half and three year olds in the Early School's 3-day program. This is the perfect environment for a young woman who has worked with children all of her adult life. A graduate of the University of Michigan Dearborn, Kate has worked as a nanny, run a summer camp at Pier Park for children ages 3 to 7, and operates a play group for two-year-olds on Tuesday and Thursday mornings (the days she is not at the Academy). She also worked as an assistant in the junior elementary room at The Giving Tree.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051021093340.jpg" border=0></P><P>&nbsp;"Everyone has been wonderful," Kate says. "The parents have been very helpful and supportive." To ease the transition of being the "new kid" at the Early School, she has also relied on the nine years of experience of classroom assistant Eula Hankins. "Eula has been awesome," says Kate. In addition, Kate will be rotating among the kindergarten teachers five afternoons a week. She is on a 21-day rotation schedule, and will spend time in every kindergarten classroom twice. </P><P>It is the children themselves who have made the transition easiest for Kate. "They are hilarious," she says. "They surprise me with how much they want to do."&nbsp; She is pleasantly surprised by how independent they are at such a young age. "I am finding out their personalities and what materials I should put out to reflect that," she says. "I enjoy watching them come out of their shells while their individual personalities emerge. I'm amazed how smart everyone is."</P><P>She has opted to make a lot of materials, something she enjoys doing, to best match the children's growing intellects and curiosity. She has themes for the month, such as Manners and Families in November and Holidays of the World in December. In addition, the children will study the continents, and she hopes to have parents come in the classroom to cook food from that continent.</P><P>&nbsp;"In keeping with the Montessori philosophy, I want to expose the children to a wide range of the world," Kate says. "At the same time, I need to keep it basic. It is a young class, but I hope to give them some exposure to prepare them when they go into other classrooms next year."</P><P>Says Kate: "My main goal is for them to have fun and enjoy school so that they look forward to coming for five days next year."</P>]]></content:encoded>

He has also served on a number of boards, including Cottage Hospital, of which his grandmother was a founding board member, the Henry Ford Health System Hospice Board, and the Farms Foundation Board.</P><P>&nbsp;"I feel it's important to volunteer your services," says Ben. "It's also important to be involved in your child's education. Serving on the Board allows you to be active and involved in what's going on. You can be part of the solution and help make a difference."</P><P>Ben and his wife, Carol, chose the Academy for their eldest child, Streeter, when they moved back to the area from California because they had heard a lot of good things about the school from friends whose children attended it.</P><P>&nbsp;"The main thing that drew us to the Academy was the emphasis on values and respecting others," says Ben. "This was what distinguished it from other schools in the area. We also liked the size and the feel, and the warmth of the campus."</P><P>Streeter, who began as a first grader, graduated in 2005. His younger sister, Chandler, is currently in the fifth grade in Mrs. Teetaert's class.</P><P>Ben and Carol appreciate the values that have been instilled in their children throughout their years at the Academy. Ben was particularly impressed with Streeter's graduating class. "There was great camaraderie in that class," he says. "The kids were never afraid to help a fellow student. It's not a competitive, cutthroat environment. One of the things the Academy fosters in the students is to be a helper. I think that's what the world needs - kids who are willing to pick each other up when they need it."</P><P>Ben also appreciates the accessibility to administration and faculty. "You can pick up the phone and call Phil [Demartini] any time with a question or a problem," he says. "Carol and I enjoy the open door policy. You don't have to go through layers of bureaucracy to reach someone."</P><P>Ben also cites the buddy program and the fact that "there is a place for every child" as two unique aspects of the school.</P><P>Streeter is currently attending Eaglebrook School in Deerfield, Massachusetts. When his father asks him what he misses most about home, Streeter's response is: "I miss school. I miss the Academy."</P><P>Says Ben: "I think he misses the culture here that is very special."</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>"Has anyone here ever felt like a loser?" asked Sean Hogan-Downey, A.C.S.W.</P><P>Hands went up around the room. Present were parents and students in Wendy Demartini's fifth grade classroom. They were participating in a book group discussion facilitated by Sean, who is a licensed marriage and family therapist and the Academy's school counselor and staff consultant.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051028154646.jpg" border=0></P><P>The book being discussed was <EM>Loser</EM>, by Jerry Spinelli. Parents read the books with their children and attended a breakfast/book discussion on Thursday, October 27. The central theme of the book involved social issues surrounding friendship.</P><P>"I need to draw a lesson for these fifth graders in this room," said Sean. "You are past the stage that everything is sunshine. There is a way you can be like Zinkoff [the protagonist of the novel]. You don't have to let people get to you."</P><P>Sean cited her favorite line in the book as follows: "Big-kid eyes replace little-kid eyes." A discussion followed to clarify what this means. "You need big eyes to see the meaning behind things," explained Sean. "That's what we're doing today, looking at the meaning behind this book. Big eyes also often make us critical, and when you get critical, you start to separate yourself from people. For example, name calling starts when you get 'big eyes.'"</P><P>The students talked about what it means to be accepted socially and how it feels to be bullied or not picked for a game. Strategies were discussed for how to deal with those moments when one does feel like a "loser."</P><P>"Sometimes I cry," said Giovanna Posselius. </P><P>"You have to step back and define whether you really lost or whether you can get back up and keep trying," added Jeff Smith, parent of Gerard Smith.</P><P>Other suggestions included learning to use your "big eyes" to look at the big picture and learning how to laugh at yourself.</P><P>"You may never call someone a loser yourself," said Sean to the students, "but I sure hope you'd be active if you heard someone else called a loser. I would hope you wouldn't be what I call a bystander. Why should someone have to cry without arms around him or her? Why would you turn down someone who wants to play? There's no reason in fifth grade why big eyes have to be only critical. They should also see beyond themselves. Little kids with little eyes see and think about themselves. You're at the age when you should start to consider other people."</P><P>Sean also had a message for the parents present: "We tend to put our kids in a box, but sometimes the box doesn't fit."</P><P>Michelle Schaller, parent of Lauren Schaller, agreed. "The character [of Zinkoff] was odd, but so true to himself that the bully ended up respecting him." The students made the point that it is important to stand up for yourself as well as others. The final message of the book was that by remaining true to himself and not changing who he was, Zinkoff changed the people around him.</P><P>"Zinkoff may not have had a best friend," pointed out Marsha Goan, parent of Conor Tily, "but he sure knew how to be one."</P><P>Sean Hogan-Downey is on campus for both parents and students on Mondays from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Thursdays from 10:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Please contact Michelle Alt at <A href="mailto:malt@gpacademy.org">malt@gpacademy.org</A> to schedule an appointment. Sean's office is located on the first floor of the Lakeshore Building.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grosse Pointe Academy second graders, along with Mr. Lapadot and Mrs. Demartini's fifth grade science class, enjoyed a special visit on October 27 from Dr. Pam Hammel, a forensic odontologist and grandmother to second grader Katherine FitzSimons. The timing of Dr. Hammel's visit was perfect; not only did it coincide with the second grade unit on the human body, it also came shortly before Halloween. Accompanying Dr. Hammel was a woman who has been dead for over 80 years.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051104135929.jpg" border=0></P><P>Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Hammel, the children had the rare opportunity to see an actual human skeleton, in this case the skeleton of a woman who lived in the late 1800s and donated her body to science in the 1920s. Dr. Hammel also brought along several human skulls.</P><P>The students learned interesting facts from Dr. Hammel, including the fact that doctors can tell a male skeleton from a female skeleton by the shape of the skull and the pelvis, and that the sturdiest bone in a human body is the femur.</P><P>"Your body is the most incredible machine ever," Dr. Hammel told the children. "Your eyes are better than the best camera. Your brain is better than the best computer. So take good care of your bodies."</P><P>Dr. Hammel explained that a forensic odontologist is "just a fancy word for dentist" and that her job is to identify people from their teeth. In fact, she was headed to New Orleans the next day to assist in the ongoing effort to identify the remains of victims from Hurricane Katrina.</P><P>The children were delighted when Dr. Hammel gave them the opportunity to name the skeleton. The winning suggestion was Bonita Bojangles.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Nutritional oncologist Dr. Cynthia Browne, M.D., Ph.D., gave a presentation to the 4/5 students in the Lake Shore Parlor on Tuesday, November 1 on practicing good nutrition. Dr. Browne is the Director of Cancer Care in Radiation Oncology at the Van Elslander Cancer Center and is a national speaker in the field of nutritional oncology. </P><P>Dr. Browne discussed nutrition in our world today, the importance of nutrition in the children's development, connections between pesticides and cancer, the benefits of eating organic food, and nutritional supplements for a healthy immune system.</P><P>Visiting the day after Halloween, Dr. Browne gave the children concrete reasons why they should avoid consuming too much sugar. "Your brain doesn't feed on Milky Ways," she said. "Your brain feeds on the sugar in your blood - it's called glucose." In addition, she made the statement that a can of pop decreases the immune system's ability to fight infection for up to six hours. Pop - or rather the phosphoric acid put in it - is also the leading cause of what Dr. Browne referred to as an epidemic among teenage athletes. These athletes suffer from stress fractures due to the fact that the phosphoric acid leeches calcium from their bones. "So drink your milk," Dr. Browne advised.</P><P>Dr. Browne brought in organic apples to share with the students and conducted an experiment in which sliced apples that were sprinkled with vitamin C turned less brown than those left unprotected in the air, illustrating the importance of this vitamin in helping repair damage from oxidation.</P><P>"If you left a Twinkie under your bed for two years, what would happen to it?" Dr. Browne asked the students. Everyone agreed that it would remain exactly the same due to chemicals and preservatives. On the other hand, Dr. Browne pointed out, an apple left under a bed would eventually rot due to the bacteria that would feed on it. The moral of this tale? "If the bacteria don't want it, you shouldn't want it either," said Dr. Browne.</P><P>The 4/5 study on nutrition, an integral part of the science curriculum, was greatly enhanced by Dr. Browne's presentation. Special thanks go to parent Pam Yates for making the arrangements. Dr. Browne's visit will be followed up by the Grade 4/5 Nutrition Fair on December 13.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alumni History Day: A New GPA Tradition</title>
		<link>http://www.gpacademy.org/news/alumni-history-day-a-new-gpa-tradition/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>On Thursday, November 10, students in first through eighth grade experienced a taste of what it would have been like to be a student at the Academy prior to 1969, when the school was operated by the Religious of the Sacred Heart as a day and boarding primary, middle and upper school for girls.</P><P>Back in the Academy of the Sacred Heart days, it was a tradition for the nuns to surprise the students with something called a <EM>cong?</EM>. A <EM>cong?</EM> was defined for the students as ?a formal or authoritative decision to depart; an abrupt dismissal; a leave taking; a day of celebration for the entire school.?</P><P>This ?celebration for the entire school,? sponsored by the Academy Alumni Association, began when Head of School Phil Demartini and Director of Advancement Paul Harrell rang a bell up and down the hallways, as the nuns used to do. Surprised students poked their heads out of their classrooms to discover what all the commotion was about. Their teachers quickly ushered them up to the auditorium, where Alumni Association President Roselie Posselius gave a brief introduction and told them what was in store for the afternoon during Alumni History Day.</P><P>First the students viewed a PowerPoint presentation entitled ?The Grosse Pointe Academy Journey Through Time: Then and Now.? Archival photos of historic buildings, landmarks, interior scenes, events, activities and even people were juxtaposed against present day photos. The students were especially pleased to see such familiar faces as Miss Camille, Mr. Tily, Mrs. Chrisner, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Wolney and Mr. Lapadot ? both ?then? and ?now.?</P><P>Following the slide show, the students broke into groups for a scavenger hunt that took them all over the school and the campus in an historical romp. They were guided in their hunt by such clues as ?Way back in time, there were plants and beasts / On which daily the nuns would feast! / Little by little, the apple trees were cut, / Now we are left with this mysterious hut!? (Answer: the Barn) Another clue was: ?There?s a historic lane / Leading up to a glass pane / Shaped in a heart / Look for the small stones for the place to start.? (Answer: Pillars and Heart Entranceway)</P><P>At each stop along the hunt, students were greeted by adult ?ambassadors? who provided historical information about that particular site. The sites included the Lakeshore Parlor, faculty lounge, orchard farm, chicken coop, St. Madeline Sophie statue, and, finally, the Nun?s Walk: ?I?m long and narrow, a pathway to pray / It used to be quiet, now a place to play / Come walk down with me, and look at my trees / This famous walk is known for its breeze!?</P><P>At the conclusion of the hunt, students headed back to their classrooms for another Sacred Heart tradition, the <EM>gouter</EM> (snack). At that time they were given a packet of information containing facts on each historical site to bring home and share with their families.</P><P>?Part of the purpose of this event was to integrate some of the tradition back into the school,? said Mary Alice Mecke, who wrote the clues for the scavenger hunt and prepared the fact sheets for the alumni volunteers and other adults who served as ambassadors. ?Highlights of the afternoon for me were watching the children?s faces when they saw Phil Demartini walking up and down the hallways ringing a bell, and seeing Peggy Baer dressed as a nun and Ellen Krease dressed in Carole Peabody?s old school uniform.?</P><P>The afternoon ? a true surprise and delight for the students ? would not have been possible without the efforts of many alumni, chief among them Roselie Bellanca Posselius ?73, Mary Alice O?Brien Mecke ?74, and Robin Locniskar Hartnett ?82. Special thanks go to resident historian Carole Peabody ?51 for her expertise. Students, faculty, staff and administrators alike hope the <EM>cong?</EM> will become a new Academy tradition.</P><P>&nbsp;</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>Angie Granata comes to The Grosse Pointe Academy as the school?s new Director of Finance with a strong background in public accounting. As a staff auditor at Plante &amp; Moran, PLLC since 2001 and a Certified Public Accountant since 2002, she has experience in managing all aspects of financial needs for health care, non-profit, private schools, and public school district clients. She also has audit experience with pension plans and municipalities. In addition, she worked as a tax preparer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service and has a Bachelor of Business Administration with a major in Accounting from Western Michigan University.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051122120346.jpg" border=0></P><P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>&nbsp;?I love it here,? Angie says of her first four months at the Academy. ?Everyone is so awesome. Pat [McCarthy] keeps me in stitches. It?s a nice place to work in terms of community - and who can beat the view??</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>Angie has quickly immersed herself in getting to know people and learning the job. ?I really enjoy the variety of projects, from human resources to the finance piece, which I?m used to. And whoever thought I?d be doing fire drills? You never know from day to day what might come up.?</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>Angie?s goal for her first year is to go through the process and observe for herself what happens on a daily basis. After a full year?s cycle, she believes she will understand the policies and procedures in place. ?While ultimately there may be changes,? she explains, ?things are done in a certain way for a reason, so I believe it?s best to understand that before making any changes. This school year is about educating myself in addition to getting to know the school community and the policies and procedures.?</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>One of the procedures she has looked at recently is the school?s emergency plan. She and Patti Boynton, the school nurse, attended a school preparedness meeting put on by the Red Cross. This meeting coincided with Phil Demartini?s conversations with the principal at St. Paul School regarding a reciprocal evacuation. While it had always been the school?s plan to use the St. Paul gym in an evacuation (and, in turn, for St. Paul to use the Academy gym), the Academy had yet to practice the process. On November 3, the students had their first evacuation drill to St. Paul School, successfully evacuating the Academy campus in under five minutes.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>In addition to changes in her professional life, Angie has announced a change in her personal life as well. She was recently engaged to John Boyle, a pediatrician in private practice in West Bloomfield. The first person to know about the engagement was not a member of Angie?s family or a long-time friend; it was Phil Demartini. John was visiting the Academy for the first time and Angie decided to take him on a tour. On his first visit to the Chapel, John got down on one knee and proposed. The couple ran into Phil on the way out and shared their news. Angie hopes to show John more of the school the next time he comes to visit - when she is less distracted!</FONT></P><P></P>]]></content:encoded>

David Nighteagle, a Native American from the Lakota tribe, traveled from his home in the southwestern corner of Colorado to share his talents with Academy students from the Early School through grade 8.</P><P>David?s grandfather introduced him to flutes and helped him make his first flute fifty years ago. Since then, David has hand carved over 9,000 of these beautiful instruments, some of which are on display in the Smithsonian. He has played them all over the country, including concerts in the southwest, Disney World and at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</P><P>Prior to David?s presentation, Early School students recited a poem, ?Indian Children,? and all of the students performed a Cherokee Lullaby and a Native Dance of the Kiowa under the direction of Early and Lower School music teacher Roshell Chuhran.</P><P>David interspersed the playing of his flutes with stories of his culture. He told the children that Native Americans believed that because one takes the heart of the wood out of the flute by carving out the center, one must put back one?s own heart while playing. ?Flutes are thought to have healing powers,? he said. ?The next piece I play goes out to people in your community I understand are healing right now, like Mr. Demartini, Miss Denise and Mrs. Chrisner?s son John. While I am playing, please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.?</P><P>At one point, David played two flutes at one time. He also invited several groups of students to come up on stage with him and accompany him with some percussive instruments in an improvisational manner. Pictured are (from left) David Nighteagle, Joseph Cavataio (grade 3), Allison Mobley (grade 4), Libby Watson (grade 5), and Charlie Milligan (grade 6).<BR><BR>Special thanks go to Janice Sturm for all her efforts in bringing David Nighteagle to The Grosse Pointe Academy.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Fostering a love of reading is a prime goal of the language arts curriculum at The Grosse Pointe Academy. Teachers today have a bigger challenge than in the past, however. There are many other activities besides reading that compete for children?s time and attention.</P><P>4/5 teacher Cheryl Teetaert has come up with a solution that has proven effective with her students. Her theory is that while book reports are a staple in language arts classes, sometimes they can be a chore. On the other hand, there has to be accountability that a child has actually read a book.</P><P><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051202115924.jpg" align=left border=0></P><P>In lieu of requiring a book report, Cheryl has organized parent-led book group discussions for the children. Gretchen Woodward, parent of fifth grader Katherine, can attest to the success of this program.</P><P>?I?m amazed by the children?s insights into these books,? Gretchen says. ?Their love for the book comes out in their discussions. I?ve seen a big difference in some kids who I?ve known since they were young and they didn?t really like to read ? and now you can tell how much they love reading.?</P><P>The books selected for the book group discussions deal with individuals having to survive alone in the wilderness or confront a difficult situation. The first book talks were based on two prolific young adult authors, Gary Paulsen and Jean Craighead George.</P><P>?The kids end up learning survival skills as well as life lessons,? says Gretchen. ?I?m surprised at how well they grasp these concepts at such a young age. They are so enthusiastic about reading. This is Mrs. Teetaert?s philosophy ? she wants them to love to read for reading?s sake. This was the biggest revelation to me: how much these children love to read.?</P><P>According to Gretchen, there are no specific requirements or limits to how many books the students should or can read; they simply read as many books as they can, at a pace that is comfortable for them. Once they finish a book, they meet with a group of students and a parent who leads the group discussion. The parent will ask such question as: What did you enjoy about this book? What are some of the major themes? What do you think the author was trying to accomplish with this novel? What is stronger in the book: plot or character development? The students will discuss their favorite characters, or what the main character believes in and what he or she is willing to fight for. They relate their own experiences to events that occur in the novel. They also discuss the writer?s style and whether there are any flaws in the book.</P><P>?They do a lot of writing in Mrs. Teetaert?s class,? Gretchen explains, ?but the focus here is on reading.?</P><P>Other parents and classroom friends who have participated in the book group discussions are Jocelyn Cieszkowski, Linda Heidt, Alex Miziolek, and Nina Tocco.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

This opportunity, which is part of the 4/5 social studies curriculum, is sponsored by the Grosse Pointe Historical Society. Students will travel back in time to the 1880s to the old-fashioned Provencal School dressed in attire appropriate to the late 1800s. For example, the girls will wear long skirts and a blouse with a shawl while boys may wear cotton shirts and long pants stuffed into their socks to resemble knickers. <P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051214085437.jpg" border=0></P><P>To prepare for their journey back in time, the girls have sewn bonnets and the boys have sewn vests.

They debated the merits of public versus private and ultimately chose The Grosse Pointe Academy. </P><P>?We were immediately impressed by the Academy,? says Chuck. ?We especially liked the Christian teachings and the quality of the education.?</P><P>They remain very satisfied with their decision.

This year he was asked again and accepted. Chuck will continue to serve on the Finance Commit-tee and will spend his first year getting acclimated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>&nbsp;?The time is right now for me to give the time commitment that is necessary,? Chuck explains. ?I only joined the Board two meetings ago, but with time I hope to offer some of my background and experience and work with the school to make it stronger.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Behind-the-Scenes Look at AIMS Conference XV</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>It may not be as complicated an event to plan as Super Bowl XL, but the Association of Independent Michigan Schools (AIMS) Conference is a major undertaking, especially when the event occurs on your own home turf.</P><P>No one knows this better than Barbara Karle and Mary Jo Johnson, The Grosse Pointe Academy?s AIMS representatives and organizers of this year?s conference, co-hosted by the Academy and University Liggett School on October 24. Barbara and Mary Jo started the planning process for this biennial event after the last conference ended two years ago.</P><P>&nbsp;?It?s like the Auction,? Barbara said. ?No sooner is it over than you start planning for the next one.?</P><P>Of the two-person team ? ?Camille [DeMario] called us ?the AIMS queens,?? Barb jokes. ?All we needed were crowns? ? Mary Jo was the veteran. Having chaired the 1999 conference on her own, she is happy to have Barb as a partner this year. Says Mary Jo: ?It was so much more enjoyable and less stressful to work with another person. It was a joy to work with Barb.?</P><P>The key to a successful conference, according to Barb and Mary Jo, is finding good speakers, including a keynote speaker who appeals to a wide range of teachers and is well known in the education field. Barb had heard about this year?s keynote speaker, Benjamin Zander, through an AIMS contact, and worked in conjunction with a number of people to pursue him for the AIMS 2005 Conference. Zander, who is the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, spoke on ?Experiencing the Art of Possibility.?</P><P>&nbsp;?He delivered a great message,? said Barb. ?You can live in two different worlds: the downward spiral of negativity, or the world of possibility.?</P><P>In addition to the keynote address, the conference offered 20 workshops at the two sites. The Academy sessions were designed to appeal to early childhood and elementary teachers and staff, while the ULS sessions were geared to upper and middle school participants. Featured speakers at the Academy included Sean Hogan-Downey, the Academy?s staff consultant and school counselor, who addressed dealing with difficult parents ? ?Sean got rave reviews!? said Mary Jo ? Barb?s sister Trudy McSorley, the Dean of Students at Siena Heights University, and John Badalament, who spoke on engaging fathers in students? lives and the school community. John Badalament also presented an evening lecture for parents at ULS that was open to the public. </P><P>&nbsp;?I think what impressed us most about the conference was how our whole Grosse Pointe Academy community came together to work as a team,? Barb said. ?Administrators, advancement staff, kitchen, maintenance and housekeeping staff, and faculty members all made it happen. Every facet of the school was involved, from initial planning meetings with Phil Demartini and other administrators to the participation of every faculty member the day of the conference. For example, every workshop was hosted by an Academy faculty or staff member. The series of meetings at the beginning really helped because everyone heard the same message at the same time. From there, Phil basically empowered us and supported us every step of the way.?</P><P>The day would not have flowed so smoothly without the help of Director of Technology Robert Rochte, for example, who managed the technology involved, or Food Services Supervisor Jodi DeVee, who provided box lunches and refreshments. Also critical were improvements in the sound system in the Tracy Fieldhouse thanks to the efforts of Director of Advancement Paul Harrell, and countless other people who pitched in and helped where most needed.</P><P>&nbsp;?Peggy Baer from the Advancement Office was a huge asset,? said Barb. ?She was so willing to help.?</P><P>The students were also a welcome addition. ?People liked to see the school and they also liked to see the kids,? said Mary Jo. ?They really stepped up to the plate.?</P><P>Serving as student guides (and giving up a day off from school) were sixth graders Rebecca Broderick, Henry Brophy, Anne Flick and Michael McCuish; seventh graders Taylor Bell, Walter Bridgforth, Libby Krueger, Gigi Wells and Sarah Whitaker; and eighth graders Will Basse, Ian Flick, Imani Mixon, Chanel Nichols-Geter, Nicole Smith and Matt Stanley.</P><P>The fifteenth AIMS Conference was an unmitigated success, but Barb and Mary Jo are not resting on their laurels. They are already starting to plan for the AIMS Conference XVI, to be held in 2007. In fact, in early November Barb attended the ISACS Conference in Kentucky in search of speakers, and returned to the Academy with a list of promising prospects. Apparently the Rolling Stones is not among them, but then again, this isn?t exactly the Super Bowl ? it has far more impact on the daily lives of Academy teachers and their students!<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The 2005 Academy forensics team competed in the 7th/8th grade Eastside Catholic Forensics League meet on Saturday, December 10 with outstanding results. The team earned a record six first places: Chanel Nichols-Geter (2) and Michael Leahy in the challenging category of impromptu, Alex Parker and Adam Smith in storytelling, and Nicole Smith in declamation. Chanel also earned a plaque for overall points in impromptu.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20051219091716.jpg" border=0></P><P>Second places were earned by Taylor Bell, who read her own original poetry, Alex Parker in storytelling, Robert Stanley (2) in storytelling, Nicole Smith in declamation, and Michael Leahy in impromptu.</P><P>Emily Skau earned a third place in poetry, Imani Mixon two third places in drama, and Alex Parker earned one third place in storytelling while Adam Smith earned two. The multiple interpretation team of Kendall Dixon, Samantha Fitzpatrick, Anne Flick, Susie Stefani and Samantha Sternad earned two third places. Nicole Smith earned a third in declamation, Michael Leahy a third in impromptu and Sarah Whitaker and Julia Rose O'Hara earned a third in duo interpretation. We are also especially proud of our other sixth graders who competed against seventh and eighth graders and we look forward to their returning next season: Somers Brush, Will Callewaert, Elizabeth DiMauro, Danny French, Michael McCuish, Anna Ochylski, Elizabeth Penman and Grace Rentschler. Eighth grader Laura Flowers competed strongly in declamation also.</P><P>Special thanks to all the parents who helped our team in many ways: judging, coaching, supplying lunch and snacks, organizing, car-pooling and providing general moral support. Thanks also to Walter Mosley, an Academy alum and recent law school graduate who volunteered to coach the impromptu category students, and to Early School assistant Katie Couture, a St. Thecla graduate and high school forensics veteran who spent many hours before school, after school and at lunch expertly coaching and encouraging the students. Her help during practice and at the meet was invaluable. New moderator Harriett Whitaker brings fresh energy to the job and former moderator Mary Jo Johnson now assists. It was truly a team effort and the enthusiasm and team spirit made the competition an awesome experience. We are fired up for next year. Look for a Forensics Night in the spring!&nbsp; <BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The 4/5 Nutrition Fair, held every other year as part of the science curriculum, took place on December 13. The fair started with three stations years ago and has grown to eight stations.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060206150449.jpg" border=0></P><P>In ?Inside My Pyramid,? students learned about the new nutrition released by the government. In ?Choose Sensibly,? they learned how to read labels on food products and make healthier choices. ?Dish Out Proper Proportions,? true to its name, taught about ?super sizing,? and ?Blast Off to Planet Power? was a computer game in which students fueled their rockets with healthy food choices. The goal of the game was for the players to take their rockets to Planet Power to earn a certificate. ?It wasn?t easy,? says organizer and school nurse Patti Boynton, ?but everyone can play. All you have to do is go to <A href="http://www.mypyramid.gov">www.mypyramid.gov</A> on the Internet.?</P><P>In ?Shout It Out,? students answered various questions about nutrition and were rewarded with delicious smoothies (the recipe provided by Mary Kosmalski, mother of fifth grader Jeffrey Woolstrum, along with a smoothie recipe booklet). ?Breakfast Helps You Grow and Learn? provided information on nutrients our bodies need to grow, with a concentration on carbohydrates and suggestions on breakfast cereals. ?Tips for Families? concentrated on additives put into products, from shampoos and deodorants to a variety of foods. It also emphasized the importance of family dinners.</P><P>Finally, the students conducted two experiments prior to the Nutrition Fair. In ?Building a Healthy Base,? they soaked chicken bones in coke, vinegar and coffee, observing over two weeks how the bones lost calcium and became rubbery. In ?Aim for Fitness,? they discovered the importance of drinking fluids and staying hydrated, using grapes to represent the cells in their bodies. The dried out grapes became - you guessed it - raisins!<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>When Marion Chrisner first came to teach at The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1969, the auditorium was bare except for a single piano. She literally started from scratch in developing a music curriculum for Academy students. That summer, she began her Orff training (a three-year process) and purchased the used instruments from the Orff workshop for a grand total of $369 - the price of a single instrument today! At that time, the Orff program, founded in Germany by Carl Orff, had only been in the United States for three years, and the Academy was one of the first schools in the country to initiate its use in its music curriculum. Carl Orff developed these xylophone style instruments specifically for teaching music to children.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060309113503.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>?Orff instruments are based on the pentatonic scale,? Marion explains. ?In other words, you can play any combination of notes together, and everything sounds good. This is very musically fulfilling for the children.? In addition, the Orff method promotes improvisation along with refinement of the ear.<BR><BR>Since the introduction of Orff instruments nearly 40 years ago, The Grosse Pointe Academy?s music curriculum has come a long way in promoting the school?s goal of educating the whole child. The main components of the curriculum are singing, movement and drama, music history and literacy, and rhythm and instruments. Through singing and performing, students develop their skills, participate in and enjoy music. Through movement and drama, they develop an innate confidence and interpretive use of their bodies and voices. Music history and literacy for the younger children exposes them to a variety of music and begins to develop their appreciation for music. As the children grow older, they are made aware of the development of music through the ages and assess its effect on life. Finally, rhythm and instruments provide a musical experience that involves both sides of the brain and awareness of accompaniment to music.<BR><BR>The Early School students? first musical exposure begins with Early School through Grade 3 teacher Roshell Chuhran, who introduces them to different types of music, including patriotic, folk, seasonal, sacred, multicultural and nursery rhymes. ?This helps them find their singing voices,? explains Roshell. Roshell is an advocate of exposing children to music at an early age due to the link between music education and increased intellectual ability, sequencing, right-to-left progression and hand-eye progression.<BR><BR>?In our curriculum, we build auditory skills,? says Roshell. ?Singing songs helps children with their speaking. For example, elongating vowels gives them a chance to connect sounds.? The children also work on developing a sense of pitch, memory, appropriate use of both sides of the body, the ability to distinguish between rhythm and beat, and an introduction to Orff instruments. This latter aids Roshell in getting the children to work as a group, develop a beat, find a pitch, and use their hands independently. She uses a variety of other rhythm instruments as well, such as hand drums, rhythm sticks, finger cymbals and boom pipes.<BR><BR>Music provides a supportive environment where children are free to be risk takers. A music curriculum creates what Roshell refers to as constructivism in teaching, which encourages free thinking, a sense of ownership, a guide to developing thoughts, active involvement in the process, a real world concept, thinking and understanding, and the ability to transfer these skills to other disciplines.<BR><BR>Marion Chrisner, who teaches music to grades 4-8, agrees with this philosophy.&nbsp; ?The most important thing to me is the child,? says Marion. ?Music is a love, but the growth of the child is key and what drives the curriculum. We teach children through music with the whole child as the most significant product. That?s why I give the students opportunities to try all these different things so that they are comfortable and find a niche that brings them joy.? Critical to every element of the 4-8 music curriculum is 100% participation, with every child trying and working to his or her individual level or ability.<BR><BR>?Yes, every music teacher wants to put on a show where everyone sings on pitch and dances to the same beat,? says Marion. ?But here I like to look at the bigger picture. Here is the place where you learn to work together to put something together. Here is where you feel you can do something and no one will make fun of you. Here is where you are not judged by your God-given talent alone.?<BR><BR>Following the grand opening of the new performing arts wing on February 22, Mrs. Chuhran and Mrs. Chrisner have resumed their unique styles of teaching in a brand new facility complete with state-of-the-art equipment and instruments. It is a far cry from that empty auditorium Marion encountered in 1969. Still, it is not the surroundings that have kept her hard at work all these years: it is the students that fill those surroundings. ?It?s been one heck of a ride here. When I see our kids go on to become class leaders, I know I had some part in that,? Marion says. ?It makes me feel good.?</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Ron Seykell has only been teaching creative movement at The Grosse Pointe Academy for a week, but already he is enthralled with the place. Looking around at the Early School gym with the sun streaming through the high windows, he says, ?What an amazing building this is!? He refers to the facilities themselves as ?incredible? and the location as ?perfect.?</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060113141306.jpg" border=0></P><P>As far as the students are concerned, Ron has worked with second and third graders and several Early School classes so far and is clearly impressed. ?The kids are so well behaved and really bright eyed,? he says. ?You can see the tangible results of good parenting manifest itself in these children. You can tell the difference.?</P><P>Ron is filling in for Denise Szykula while she recovers from surgery. He recognizes that her dance shoes are large ones to fill, but looks forward to carrying on the program she has created while giving it his own individual spin. ?I will definitely follow Denise?s program,? Ron explains. ?I?m not sure everyone realizes exactly how brilliant it is. It?s very methodical, building in a layering and very age appropriate way.?</P><P>However, at the same time he hopes to incorporate in the curriculum what he refers to as ?Broadway magic? ? i.e., theatre arts, theatre history, theatre games and character work.</P><P>?The arts are so important in a child?s education, and it?s obvious here that this is recognized,? Ron points out. ?Statistics back up what we have always known intuitively: that by exposing children to certain aspects of the arts, other talents might be discovered. Some of these children may never dance again after they leave the Academy, but dance may open a window into something else. For example, a child might be exposed to an artist through the expression of movement and discover a love of color.?</P><P>Moreover, as Ron points out, the arts reduce stress, improve speaking and listening skills, and (as statistically demonstrated) result in the likelihood that students will get better grades in school, go on to higher paying jobs, and achieve leadership positions.</P><P>For now, however, Ron, who is a veteran Broadway actor who has performed in <EM>Cats, Les Miserables</EM> and <EM>Jesus Christ Superstar</EM>, to name a few, is content to begin by getting acquainted with the children and sharing with them his unique brand of energy and his enthusiasm for the performing arts.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

The leading runner on the girls? cross-country team, Somers Brush was named Most Valuable Runner by her teammates and coach. The three sixth graders all participated on the girls? JV basketball team and were given the MVP award (Grace), Bulldog award (Emmy), and Sportsmanship award (Somers).&nbsp; All three are scholar athletes and are on the high honors roll, citizenship list and Head of School list.</P><P>Generally a boy and a girl who excel in one or more sports are named Athlete of the Season in the fall and spring. ?While sometimes two girls or two boys might be named in a given season, it?s rare for three athletes to share this distinction,? said Athletic Director Michael Fultz. ?It?s also rare for this award to be given to a sixth grader. These three young ladies distinguished themselves athletically in their respective sports but were so evenly matched that the coaches thought all three deserved to be recognized."<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The 2005-2010 Grosse Pointe Academy Long Range Plan issued this fall makes the following statement: ?The Academy recognizes that in order to provide the finest educational experience for its students and to prepare them for success in a multicultural and global world, we must strive to create an inclusive, diverse community that will challenge them to make reasonable and moral decisions and teach them tolerance, appreciation and respect for all races and religions.? One of the implementation strategies outlined in the Long Range Plan is to ?maintain a strong Diversity Committee to oversee diversity initiatives throughout the school.?</P><P>That Diversity Committee, which grew out of a Diversity Task Force established in 2001-02, has been in existence for several years under the leadership of Rosi Triano. </P><P>&nbsp;?Promoting diversity has long been a love of mine,? explains Rosi, who teaches K-3 art and also serves as the Academy?s representative on the Southeast Michigan Diversity Committee (SEMDC). This group meets four times a year at different locations (most recently at the Academy), with members taking part in a round robin sharing of activities and planning such events as the Teacher of Color Job Fair, the Middle School and High School Symposiums, and the Bi-Annual Teachers? Workshop. The Job Fair furthers the committee?s goal to recruit faculty and staff members of color. Rosi has attended the past several years, oftentimes accompanied by Phil Demartini.</P><P>As the SEMDC rep, Rosi shares activities that have proven successful at the Academy and also culls ideas to bring back to colleagues. Another favorite aspect of her committee work is reading and discussing books on diversity. </P><P>Says Rosi: ?The Academy provides an environment that encourages and promotes the concept of valuing the similarities and uniqueness of each person. The goal of the diversity committee is for GPA to become a beacon in the community to teach children to understand, appreciate and treasure the differences and similarities of different races, ethnic backgrounds, learning styles and points of view.?</P><P>One of the charges of the Diversity Task Force was to define diversity. Seven specific characteristics of diversity were established: ethnicity, race, religion, culture, gender, geography and economics.</P><P>&nbsp;?Part of the difficulty I encounter is communicating effectively how many different ways we approach diversity at this school,? explains Rosi. ?I can talk about specific classroom activities we do for Black History Month, for example, but that?s just one month out of the school year. We do so much more than that, such as the international parade we held last year as part of the Journey Around the World theme, hosting David Nighteagle this year during our tribute to Native Americans, or having Carla Jackson (the Multicultural Coordinator for Cranbrook School) conduct diversity awareness workshops for our faculty.?</P><P>Finally it comes down to the children?s awareness of each other?s differences. Subtle messages can be delivered even in art class. Says Rosi: ?I handed a child a peach-colored crayon and he said, ?That?s skin color.? ?Well, it might be your skin color but there are many skin colors,? I replied.?</P><P>&nbsp;?The children we are educating today are the leaders of tomorrow,? Rosi says. ?If they can work inclusively and collaboratively today with all different types of people, imagine what they will do tomorrow as our future leaders.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=#333333><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=black>Academy families enjoyed a celebration of math during the Math Fair on March 8. Colorful displays showcased the problem-solving abilities of students in Early School through Grade 8, and young attendees enjoyed a variety of games and activities. A highlight of the evening was a presentation by David Schwartz, author of <EM>How Much is a Million</EM> and <EM>If You Hopped Like a Frog</EM>, among many other award-winning children's books. Mr. Schwartz shared his love of numbers and literature, engaged the audience with his storytelling abilities, and, in the conclusion of his presentation,&nbsp;involved the children in demonstrating truly "how much is a million."</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P><P align=center><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=#333333><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=black><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060310100718.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=#333333><FONT color=steelblue><FONT color=#000000>On Thursday, Mr. Schwartz gave a series of workshops to the students. Says David, "Children love big numbers in the same way they love big animals like dinosaurs and whales, and for that reason big numbers are the perfect way to get kids excited about math." David used a variety of visual aids to make numbers come to life, including producing a bag filled with 100,000 kernels of popcorn!<BR></FONT><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT></P><P>Since publication in 1985, <EM>How Much is a Million?</EM> has become the classic children?s book on large numbers. Illustrated by Steven Kellogg, it has won several awards and has been featured on Public Televisions ?Reading Rainbow.? Schwartz?s recent book, <EM>Q is for Quark: A Science Alphabet Book</EM>, is a zany, brainy, mind-boggling and amusing romp through the world of science. It is written at the upper elementary and middle school level, a higher reading level than his other books except for its companion, <EM>G is for Googol: A Math Alphabet Book</EM>, which was published to numerous accolades in 1998. His latest book, <EM>Millions to Measure,</EM> also illustrated by Steven Kellogg, does for measurement what <EM>How Much is a Million?</EM> did for big numbers: it renders the subject accessible, mind-boggling, and fun.</P><P>As a speaker, Schwartz is entertaining and informative. His presentation makes math and science fun in ways that many adults never thought possible. </P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=black>Please welcome the Academy's new lacrosse and girls' soccer coaches, John (Chip) Russell Fowler III and Cheryl Piccione.<BR><BR>Chip Fowler is a native of Grosse Pointe and attended University Liggett school from elementary through high school. He played lacrosse at ULS, where he was coached by John Fowler (who, despite the same name, is not related to him). He then went on to play club lacrosse at Purdue University. Chip served as the assistant coach for ULS's high school varsity football team this fall. He is currently taking graduate classes at Wayne State University in History and Public Administration and plans to apply to law school.<BR><BR>Soccer has been a big part of Cheryl Piccione's life for many years, and only this past year did she officially hang up her cleats and retire from her women's league team. Having grown up in St. Louis, she played on a travel team as well as for her high school and college and was named all-state in high school. She has lived in Michigan for 14 years and has two daughters: Nicole, who is a freshman at Grosse Pointe South, and Emily, who is a third grader at Trombly. Cheryl has coached soccer for the Neighborhood Club and the Grosse Pointe Soccer Association.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060412142744.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

Accompanying the team were parents, coach Dr. Ed Mandell of All the King?s Men in Warren, and faculty advisor Wendy Demartini, a fourth grade teacher at the Academy who is also the curriculum coordinator.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060216100028.jpg" border=0></P><P>Several players also earned individual medals for their performances. Third grader Jared Dempsey and fifth grader Jeffrey Woolstrum won silver medals, while fourth grader Karstan Minanov and fifth grader Steven Ragland shared a silver medal. Finally, third grader Joseph Cavataio received a bronze medal. </P><P>The Academy formed an after school chess club for kindergarten through fifth grade students five years ago. The club has grown in popularity over the years, in particular with younger students. During the past three years the school has invited local elementary schools to participate in a K-6 chess invitational, in which individual trophies are awarded. The first invitational for this year was held in December, with a second one tentatively scheduled for May 24. Due to the success of the chess club and the burgeoning interest in chess in general, Demartini decided last year to form a chess team. The team meets on Friday mornings from 7:30 to 8:30 a.m. under the direction of Dr. Mandell.</P><P>For information on The Grosse Pointe Academy chess invitational in May, please contact Wendy Demartini at <A href="mailto:wdemartini@gpacademy.org">wdemartini@gpacademy.org</A>. <BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

The problems are designed to encourage students to use a variety of problem solving techniques in the areas of mathematical and visual problem solving.<BR><BR>This was the first year at the Academy that students in grades 2-8 participated in the Continental Math League competition. Grades 2 and 3 have three meets while grades 4-8 have five meets. The top six scores at each grade are sent in to the CML headquarters in New Jersey. </P><P>Special recognition was given to fifth grader Dylan Demkowicz, who received a perfect score of 30. According to fifth grade teacher Wendy Demartini, who coordinates the CML competition for the Academy, Dylan received one of approximately 40 perfect scores across the country among fifth graders who participated in the competition this year. A special plaque will be hung in Dylan?s honor in recognition of this achievement.</P><P>The top scorers for their grade in the Continental Math League competition are as follows (pictured clockwise from front row, far right): Alexander Minanov (Grade 2), Jared Brush (Grade 3), Caleb Cimmarrusti (Grade 4), Dylan Demkowicz (Grade 5), Grace Rentschler (Grade 6), Somers Brush (Grade 6), Evan Schwartz (Grade 7), and Matthew Stanley (Grade 8).</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060413140404.jpg" border=0><BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

For others, our parent volunteer team will begin making calls during "You Make a Difference" Week. (Make your pledge early, and you can avoid the call!) New parents will be invited to a cocktail party on November 9 so that they may meet other new parents and learn more about the Academy.</P><P>This year, parents will have the opportunity to designate their gift to one or more of the following areas that you are most interested in supporting.<BR><BR><STRONG>General Fund</STRONG><BR>Unrestricted support allows the school the most flexibility in directing funds to areas where they will have the greatest impact.<BR><BR><STRONG>Technology and Classroom Support<BR></STRONG>Technology is an increasingly powerful tool that can be used to enhance student learning.<BR><BR><STRONG>Faculty Support<BR></STRONG>Independent schools need to attract and retain highly competent, qualified and caring faculty members to lead academic, arts and athletic programs.<BR><BR><STRONG>Character Development</STRONG><BR>Whether it is spiritual enrichment through Christian life classes and special Chapel assemblies, community service programs that expand the boundaries of the classroom, or involvement in afterschool athletics, the Academy emphasizes moral and ethical character development in young people to help prepare them to assume leadership roles later in life.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grade 4/5 teacher Cheryl Teetaert enjoyed a special visit in April from a former student, Reed Harris ?94, and his parents, Inge and Reed. Reed was home visiting from Santa Monica, where he works for KUD International, a program management and development company that specializes in the development of large-scale public-private projects. These projects include aquariums, museums, professional football and baseball stadiums, and educational facilities. Reed is currently Assistant to the President.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060505102025.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>What prompted the visit was a special fondness Reed and his parents share for GPA. The timing was particularly appropriate, as it came during Mrs. Teetaert?s final year of teaching before retirement. Reed was one of her first students at the Academy.<BR><BR>Reed came to GPA as a second grader while his sister, Tiffany ?99, began in the Early School. The family lives in New Baltimore, and for eleven years Mrs. Harris made the commute back and forth to school, dropping the children off at 7 a.m. so she could arrive on time for her teaching job at Lake Shore High School in St. Clair Shores.<BR><BR>Says Mrs. Harris: ?Everything at the Academy was the best. I don?t regret a minute of it. There were times my husband and I struggled financially, but we decided to make an investment in our children?s education, and we don?t regret a penny. We can?t say enough about the teachers. They are topnotch with Master?s degrees and above.?<BR><BR>Reed agrees with his mother?s assessment. ?The quality of the instructors at the Academy was a defining characteristic that sets that school apart from any other school in the country.? Reed has special memories of his second grade teacher, Mrs. DuPont, who made him ?feel at home right away,? his third grade teacher, Mrs. Thomas&nbsp; - ?What a fun person! Class was never dull and her fun and easy going personality put a smile on my face each day!? -&nbsp; and, of course, 4/5 teacher Mrs. Teetaert. She was the teacher Reed felt closest to. ?She treated each of her students like one of her own children. She truly cared about us and our future. After fifth grade, I hated to move on and leave her.?<BR><BR>Reed did in fact move on to the Middle School, and after graduating he attended De La Salle High School. It was there that he first noticed how his hard work at the Academy had paid off. ?I was ahead of everyone,? he says. ?As a freshman, I was put into honors and AP classes with sophomores and juniors. This was strictly a credit to the Academy. All the students had this opportunity. Everyone was brought up together and pushed to the same degree to go the extra distance and learn the material.?<BR><BR>Reed went on to the University of Michigan, where he received a B.S. in Industrial and Operations Engineering. Once again his hard work paid off, and he has enjoyed two years at a company that he says is one of a kind in the industry. But most importantly, he enjoys his memories of the Academy, from competing for a piece of candy from Mrs. Teetaert?s infamous ?jolly jar? to the critical role his teachers played in molding his study habits and work ethic.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>?Literacy makes for a stronger democracy,? stated author Anna-Lisa Cox to the middle school students assembled at a panel discussion of her recent book, <EM>A Stronger Kinship</EM>. On May 3, a day decreed ?AIMS Literacy Day? by Governor Granholm, middle school students from six Association of Independent Michigan Schools gathered at Friends School in Detroit to discuss the book in the presence of the author. Students used the book to study positive multicultural relations in mid-19th century Covert, Michigan. Detroit Free Press books writer Marta Salij stated in a recent review: ?The book has enormous value in reminding us that prejudice doesn?t have to be the default setting on human relationships.?</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060505143246.jpg" border=0></P><P>Representing The Grosse Pointe Academy were seventh graders Libby Krueger, Michael Leahy, Rachel Ochylski and Evan Schwartz, and eighth grader Chanel Geter. The other participating schools were Cornerstone Schools, Dearborn Heights Schools, Detroit Waldorf School, Friends School of Detroit, The Roeper School, and University Liggett School. All of the students participated in a panel discussion facilitated by Friends Head of School Dwight Wilson. Also in attendance were AIMS Director Richard Halsey and Literacy Project Manager Kathy Long. The students addressed questions within the context of the book that also related to their own lives, such as whether they or someone they knew had ever been in a situation in which they were denied service, or what actions their parents had taken to make them more accepting of the differences among people. Many students responded that their parents had made a positive step in this area by choosing an independent school.</P><P>?Color blindness is not the goal,? stated Ms. Cox. ?It is natural and human to recognize differences in people ? differences in clothing, hair style or skin color. It is getting beyond those differences and getting to know a person as an individual that is important.?</P><P>According to Michael Leahy, the book ?showed how children who are raised in an integrated society grow up to be integrated people.?&nbsp; Said Evan Schwartz: ?We have to talk to each other to create stronger kinships.? Rachel Ochylski believed that the discussion ?opened up my eyes to how racism isn?t something from long ago and that it has to do with more than the color of a person?s skin.?</P><P>The question of what makes a leader came up during the discussion. Dwight Wilson responded: ?A leader is the first person to stand up and do the right thing.? This statement seemed to resonate with the Academy students. Said Libby Krueger: ?Leadership is all about choices. You have to have the courage to stand up for what is right.?</P><P>?Even if your friends are against it or make fun of you for it,? agreed Evan.</P><P>Echoed Rachel: ?Even if you?re standing alone.?</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><BR>&nbsp;</P>]]></content:encoded>

After studying a volume by a favorite poet and completing a poetry wheel as a book report, the students set to work writing poetry of their own. To celebrate completion of their poetry journals, language arts teacher Harriett Whitaker organized a "Poetry Caf?" on Tuesday. Students brought in refreshments and sat on pillows and beanbag chairs to listen to their peers' selected readings from their journals. The next day the classes convened outdoors on the old basketball court on the Lakeshore lawn to&nbsp;incorporate art into their poetry&nbsp;through the use of a new medium: sidewalk chalk. The result? Sidewalk poetry!</FONT></FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060512135139.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

Accompanying Early and Lower School French teacher Claudia Leslie and Middle School French teacher Judyth Stayton were Debby Wolney's third grade class and a group of&nbsp;seven seventh graders. The younger students presented interesting facts about France and its landmarks, then recited a poem and sang a song, both in French. The older students performed an original skit in French called "Money Can't Buy You Happiness."<BR><BR>The theme for the month at SOC was France, so the timing of the visit was perfect!</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060519143745.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=black>As a culminating activity for their unit on the medieval period in social studies class with Harriett Whitaker and Mary Jo Johnson, sixth graders staged a medieval feast on May 19. Present at the "manor on the lake" were the king and queen, lords and ladies, knights, squires, a priest, pages and jesters. Serving wenches (i.e., parents) served the three-course banquet of soup and bread, chicken legs, saffron rice and peas, and cookies. A food taster sampled each course before it was approved for consumption by the king and queen. During the course of the four-hour banquet, knightings were performed, the royal court was entertained by original dances, juggling, a magic act, piano solos and poetry readings, to name a few, and justice was served when several wrongdoers were brought before the court for judgments. Several were pardoned for their criminal acts, while others landed in the dungeon.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060519150015.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>With a business and law background, Bret Wacker brings a great deal of experience and knowledge to the Academy?s Board of Trustees. The 2006-07 school year marks his sixth year on the Board, where he has chaired the Technology Committee and the Educational Policy Committee, sat on the Finance Committee, and chaired last year?s Christian Task Force. This year Bret follows Michael Fisher?s footsteps as President of the Board. Michael stepped down from the Board in June following nine years of service to GPA, the last three as President.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20060922143245.jpg" border=0></P><P>Bret and his wife, Sharon, moved to Sharon?s hometown of Grosse Pointe Farms in 1996 for a job opportunity at Compuware. Bret served as senior counsel at Compuware for ten years, but this past April took advantage of an opportunity to develop and lead a business when he joined Adecco Group North America as Senior Vice President, Government Solutions. Bret?s role at Adecco, the world?s largest staffing company, is to craft and execute the company?s federal contracting strategy. At any point in the week he may be found in his home office in Grosse Pointe Farms, in his office in Washington D.C., at the company headquarters in New York, or at a U.S. Government customer site anywhere else in the U.S.</P><P>Born and raised on the East Coast, Bret received a bachelor?s degree in journalism from Penn State University and his law degree from Vermont Law School. Bret combines strong communication and analytical skills, attention to detail and keen business acumen with something equally powerful to his role as Board president: a deep affection for the school. This affection stems from his years not only as a trustee and volunteer, but as a parent as well. </P><P>As Bret describes it, the Academy is committed ?to creating a total child with a love of learning. After that, the child?s natural talents will take over. Our job is to establish the academic foundation for them to be successful lifelong learners. We also support their physical well being and spiritual lives by creating an atmosphere that fosters both.?</P><P>?Like a business, our ?product? is all we can measure ourselves by, and I think the Academy produces a first-rate product in its graduates. We are uniformly told by the high schools that our students are poised and prepared, as well as being curious and active learners,? says Bret. ?As an independent school in this area, we are asked all the time: why should a parent spend the money when there is a good public school system in the community? It is the total child commitment that distinguishes a school like the Academy. The whole child is what an independent school focuses on.?</P><P>Bret, as Chair of the Christian Task Force, has played a key part in the school?s efforts to further define and articulate the spiritual component of its mission. ?The Academy?s role in the spiritual part of our students? lives is to support the foundation established by their parents. Our parents are responsible for making choices of faith for their children, and the Academy supports those choices by reinforcing community service, teaching respect for others, and its commitment to family.?</P><P>The Wackers first looked at the Academy when their oldest child, Kate, was a preschooler. They explored all their options, including public, private and parochial, but were swayed toward GPA by a particular person they met during their tour.</P><P>?A remarkable young lady led us around,? Bret explains, ?and I think she was the deciding factor. Naturally we were impressed by the curriculum, the buildings, and the enthusiasm of the teachers, but it was the tour guide who flipped the switch for us. When Sharon and I walked out afterwards, we looked at each other and said, ?If our little person turns out like that young lady, it will be well worth the investment.??</P><P>Bret and Sharon trusted their instincts with their first child and have not regretted their decision since. Their experience with Kate, now in sixth grade, and later with son Thomas, who joined the Early School last fall, has merely reinforced their impression that the Academy produces poised and confident young people like that eighth grade tour guide. They have also never had a teacher they ?can?t speak highly enough of - and I don't think we've just been lucky,? says Bret. ?I think that?s just the nature of the faculty.?</P><P>Bret is looking forward to the start of this school year. His goals for his tenure as President include working with the other members of the Board, as well as Phil Demartini and his team, successfully completing the current Phase II construction of the classroom building and the Capital Campaign, and making continued progress on achieving the objectives of the Academy?s current Long Range Plan.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The theme for this year's Scholastic Book Fair, hosted by the PCC, is "Reading Rainforest: Wild for Books!" GPA students do in fact go wild for the Book Fair and love the opportunity to browse the selections with their grandparents and special friends as well as with their school buddies. Proceeds from this event go directly into funding book orders for the library.<BR><BR>The hours are as follows:<BR><BR><STRONG>Friday, October 13, 8 a.m. - 12 p.m.</STRONG><BR>Grandparents'/Special Friends' Day<BR><BR><STRONG>Monday, October 16, 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.<BR></STRONG><BR><STRONG>Tuesday, October 17, 8 a.m. - 6 p.m.</STRONG> <EM>(Note extended hours!)</EM><BR>Grade 6 Parent/Teacher Conferences<BR><BR><STRONG>Wednesday, October 18, 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.</STRONG><BR><BR><STRONG>Thursday, October 19, 8 a.m. 4 p.m.</STRONG><BR>No School - Parent/Teacher Conferences<BR><BR>The Academy has the opportunity to participate in a special philanthropic effort this year, called "One for Books."&nbsp;Each child who brings in one dollar to the Book Fair will have his or her name displayed on a palm leaf (in keeping with the Amazon theme). Scholastic Books has agreed to donate one book for every dollar raised to one of three national literacy charities. In addition, that same amount raised will be used to purchase materials from our Book Fair, which will then be donated to the Monteith Library in Detroit, a library refurbished by the Junior League of Detroit. We are asking children in grades 4-8 to participate in the "One for Books" program and to think of ways they can donate their own money from their piggybanks or allowances in lieu of asking their parents. Please contact Book Fair co-chairs Cheryl DiMauro, Karen French or Linda Heidt with any questions.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Brian DeMaggio?s Spanish students in grades 6-8 studied <EM>Dia de los Muertos</EM> (the Day of the Dead) in early November. Brian introduced the students to such customs popular in Latino communities as making an <EM>ofrenda</EM>, or shrine, for dead loved ones. Typically an <EM>ofrenda</EM> would include a picture of the person, marigolds, fake skulls or skeletons, food and drink, and objects that represent what that person enjoyed while on earth. This Friday was the culminating event of this weeklong study. To make the celebration as authentic as possible, Brian ordered <EM>Pan de Muertos</EM> (?Bread of the Dead?) from Mexicantown Bakery and <EM>calaveras</EM> (sugar skulls) from Algo Especial Market for his students to sample. ?The bumps (on the bread) signify tears and bones of dead loved ones,? he explained to the students. He also made a traditional drink from Ecuador called <EM>colada morada</EM>. While many of the ingredients necessary for this drink are not available in the United States, such as berries that are indigenous to Ecuador, Brian replicated it as closely as possible using blueberries, blackberries and pineapple and mixing it with cinnamon and cloves to give it the proper flavor and corn syrup to give it the proper thickness. The punch is served warm and, authentic or not, the&nbsp;students seemed to enjoy it. ?It tastes like Kool-aid!? said one.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20061103104921.jpg" border=0></P><P>On&nbsp;November 1 and 2&nbsp;there was a walking tour in Mexicantown where the public could visit various <EM>ofrendas</EM> and exhibits in Southwest Detroit. Brian encouraged his students to attend.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sixth Graders Study Scientific Method on Campus</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Every year I am asked by kids, ?Why do we have to do this??? says science teacher Michael Fultz of the sixth grade leaf project, a well-known staple of his science curriculum. ?They want to know why it?s important to be able to identify all of the trees on campus. I tell them that trees are the most dominant organism around them. Step outside ? there are trees all around you. You should be able to identify them.?</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20061117114715.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><BR>Mike also believes that the leaf project is a great way to start off the year. ?It?s not abstract,? he explains. ?It?s right in front of you. It?s doing science. If you follow the key and make careful observations, you?ll come to the correct conclusion. That?s what this is all about ? getting kids to make careful observations and to look for subtle differences in order to discover the correct answer. This is the scientific method.?<BR><BR>There are four steps to the process. The first step is learning how to use a dichotomous key and make good identifications based on the characteristics of the trees. For example, does the plant have needle-like or scale-like leaves? Are the needles more than one centimeter long? Do they occur in bundles or in groups along the twigs?<BR><BR>The second step is identifying and collecting leaves. The students preserve their leaves in books until they are ready to place them in a photo album. Once this step is completed, they will have collected and learned to identify 41 different types of trees on the school property.<BR><BR>?There are even more trees on campus,? Mike says, ?but many of them are exotic and the kids will never see them again. I concentrate on the more common trees they will see everywhere.? The students learn some interesting facts about the trees along the way. For example, they learn that bowling alleys are made out of sugar maple. Baseball bats are made from ash, because it is lightweight and strong, and absorbs shock well. Hardwood floors are often made out of oak, and furniture may be made out of woods like cherry, maple and walnut.<BR><BR>In identifying the trees, the students will use terms like ?opposite simple? and ?alternate simple? and look for such characteristics as the color, lobes and teeth of the leaves and the texture, color or peel of the bark. For example, the bark on a locust peels sideways, and what Mike calls ?the give-away? to identifying a white cedar is that it is the only tree on campus with tiny scales rather than needles. An astute observer trained to use several of his or her senses might also comment that the scales smell like grape bubblegum.<BR><BR>The students are finished collecting their leaves during the first few weeks of the fall, but their fieldwork is still not done. The next step is for them to answer the question: What is the most important tree on the school?s property?<BR><BR>In the experiment, the importance value of the trees is based on size and number. ?This is when they start to learn about the scientific method,? Mike says. In order to answer this question, the students must first be able to identify the trees (a process they have of course mastered in the leaf collection phase). After measuring and counting a survey of the trees on the property, they head indoors with their compiled data ? to the computer lab, to be exact. There they learn how to record their data, make graphs and charts, and write an interpretation<BR><BR>?It is all part of the discovery process,? Mike says. ?If they take it step by step, follow the key, make good observations, and record good data, they will discover. This is what science is all about.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Science teacher Wendy Jewett had an unusual experiment - or what she calls an "eggsperiment" - planned for her seventh grade physics students. The students were to engineer a contraption designed to protect an egg dropped to the ground from a great height. (Originally the eggs were to be dropped from a window of the Lake Shore building, but the weather proved uncooperative and&nbsp;Wendy quickly enlisted the help of the maintenance crew to drop the eggs in the fieldhouse&nbsp;from a cherry picker raised to the height of the ceiling.)<BR><BR>First&nbsp;the students completed their control work, including measuring the distance from the cherry picker to the ground, and dropping a few sacrificial eggs to test velocity, momentum, impulse and force on impact.&nbsp;The following day&nbsp;the actual contraptions were dropped. Ideas for protecting the eggs&nbsp;ranged from innovative and ingenious to just plain tasty. Eggs were cushioned in cotton balls, jello and marshmallows, hidden in stuffed animals and pillows, and dropped on a sheet, just to name a few of the students' ideas. Next week the seventh graders will analyze their data and write their interpretations.<BR><BR>The event proved particularly entertaining for younger students, who interrupted their gym class to observe this "eggciting" event!</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sixth Graders Bond at Camp Storer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>There are many concepts that sixth graders bring home with them from their time at Camp Storer, but perhaps the most important one is ?total team.? Traditionally the sixth grade goes to Camp Storer in early fall to bond as a grade for their remaining years at the Academy, and a big part of that is learning how to work together as a team to solve problems.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20061127105739.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><BR>Camp Storer begins and ends with team building, and the concepts learned are ones applied throughout each activity. For example, during the first night, the students, along with faculty members Brian DeMaggio, Michael Fultz, Lucia Hu, Ellen Krease and Harriett Whitaker, participated in a re-enactment of the Underground Railroad. Camp Storer staff members served as slave owners and other characters, such as abolitionists, while the students were slaves and the Academy teachers their guides into freedom. In the beginning of the reenactment, the students were sold into slavery.<BR><BR>?It was a very intense, powerful experience,? said language arts and social studies teacher Harriett&nbsp; Whitaker. ?The kids still talk about the Underground Railroad. Parents have also talked about the impact that it had on their children.? One of the most memorable parts of the experience occurred to a group of ?slaves? led by Christian Life teacher Ellen Krease. ?We got lost in the woods for over an hour!? said Ellen. ?It was pretty scary.?<BR><BR>During the second day, the students studied the power of water, in which they built a river and learned about erosion and glaciers. Another unit was on Native American life. A Camp Storer staff member cooked stew and flatbread, and the students studied Indian sign language, played Indian games, invented Indian names and learned about trading.<BR><BR>On the third day, the group learned about reptiles and amphibians in a unit entitled ?In Cold Blood.? A final activity, which expanded on the ?total team? concept, was called ?The Incredible Journey? and involved a low ropes course in which the students had to work together as a team to reach success. ?The main lesson they learned was that there are some things you can?t do by yourself,? said science teacher Michael Fultz. The students also learned about ?zero waste,? which ties into the sixth grade recycling program initiated this year by Harriett Whitaker as part of the students? ongoing community service efforts.<BR><BR>One of the purposes of the trip to Camp Storer is for the sixth graders, who are making the transition into middle school, to bond as a class. ?They are going from two fifth grade classes to one sixth grade class,? explained Mike. ?By spending time together they get to know each other. They also get to know the teachers as people and vice versa.? Some of the activities at Camp Storer, such as singing silly songs and square dancing, helped to break down the barriers between students and faculty members. During the square dance on the last evening, Mike Fultz and Spanish teacher Brian DeMaggio played guitar and Mike even joined the counselors as a caller for the dances.<BR><BR>While at Camp Storer, the students learned about respect, responsibility, honesty and caring. ?These are the core values we teach at the Academy,? said Mike. Upon their return, they brainstormed as a group about these values and created a sixth grade covenant that each of them, along with the teachers who make up the sixth grade advisory team, had to sign to show their commitment. ?They take the covenant seriously,? said Mike. ?Some of them even put it on their lockers.?</P>]]></content:encoded>

The volcanoes were made at home with the help of on-line tips, the creativity of the students and their parents, and some good old-fashioned baking soda and vinegar ? along with several secret ingredients.&nbsp;This is the third time in six years that 4/5 science classes have completed this project, and each year brings a twist.&nbsp;The popular chemical mixture for this year was Diet Coke and mentos, which produced mixed results.<BR><BR>One of the strengths of the project was the amount of flexibility given to each young scientist, allowing for endless creativity. ?Our philosophy is that the children don?t need kits,? said 4/5 science teacher Bob Lapadot. ?They have vivid imaginations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Ahmed Ismail, owner of Speedi Photo, the parents of students in kindergarten through grade 3 at The Grosse Pointe Academy will receive a special gift for the holidays this year. Mr. Ismail donated in excess of 100 frames, a value of nearly $3500, to the school for use in its art program. When presented with the frames, K-3 art teacher Rosi Triano immediately thought of a perfect use for them: framing the students? artwork as Christmas gifts. The children have been busily painting over the past few weeks, and were told to select the painting they thought their parents would most enjoy. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>?Children?s artwork is always special,? says Triano, ?but this year, thanks to Mr. Ismail, the artwork will arrive home already framed. This way the artwork will be preserved for years to come. Most importantly, it will enhance the children?s pride in their work.? </P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20061219162432.jpg" border=0><BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Storyteller La'Ron Williams paid a special visit to The Grosse Pointe Academy on January 12. He met with Early School students first&nbsp;in the Tracy Fieldhouse and then did a combined presentation for Grades 1-8. Mr. Williams' stories are based on folk tales from the African/African-American tradition. He led the audience to see the important lessons that have arisen from those traditions - lessons about self-esteem, self-reliance, perseverance in the face of great challenges, and the struggle to expand the American ideal of democratic inclusion. Mr. Williams, who was dressed in traditional African clothing, played a variety of instruments to accompany his stories, including the Mbira and Djembe drums from Africa.<BR><BR>In the afternoon, Mr. Williams led a discussion tailored specifically to the seventh and eighth graders. Using humor and song while weaving history lessons into his stories, he prompted the students to use their minds and imaginations to recreate the past. "It is through sharing our combined history and culture that we gain a greater understanding of one another," he stated to the students.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070112152438.jpg" border=0><BR><BR></P><P align=left>"What an excellent introduction to our eighth grade social studies heritage unit," commented Wendy Demartini, Curriculum Coordinator, who arranged Mr. Williams' visit as part of the school's celebration of the life and work of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.</P>]]></content:encoded>

Middle school science teacher Wendy Jewett gave a demonstration to the 4/5 students on January 18, showing them how to state a problem, formulate a hypothesis, gather materials&nbsp;to&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;the experiment, and collect data before drawing their conclusions. Ms. Jewett conducted an experiment on the effect of temperature on diffusion, producing data that supported the hypothesis that the warmer the water, the faster the rate of diffusion.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070119145710.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

Using presentation boards, Mr. Pappas gave the students a glimpse of their future once the building is complete in September of 2007.<BR><BR>The fourth graders had many questions for Mr. Pappas. For example, McCalla Mecke asked whether it was fun to be an architect.<BR><BR>?The best part about being an architect is seeing your dream become a reality,? Mr. Pappas told the children. He also described some of the challenges inherent in retaining the history and architectural integrity of a 78-year-old building while at the same time bringing the classrooms up to the 21st century. Finally, he emphasized how such a major endeavor involves teamwork by a range of specialists.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Middle school students fought off the February blahs with an annual GPA tradition: Middle School Spirit Week. The&nbsp;sixth, seventh and eighth graders&nbsp;waged a friendly competition during the course of three days. For example,&nbsp;on Tuesday, otherwise known as Clash Day, the eighth graders won the trivia quiz. Wednesday's obstacle course was postponed to Thursday due to the school cancellation, and&nbsp;once again the eighth graders were the victors.&nbsp;The final tally&nbsp;will not be in until next Tuesday,&nbsp;when the wall competition will take place. Each grade will decorate a wall according to a chosen theme. For the sixth grade, the theme was the Wizard of Oz. Seventh graders chose music, and the eighth grade demonstrated opposites. The week concluded with a faculty/student dodgeball challenge.</P><P align=center><STRONG>CLASH DAY<BR><BR>Grade 6</STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070215173810.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG>Grade 7</STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070215174016.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><STRONG>Grade 8</STRONG></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070215173910.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>What is known as the Chinese New Year in this country is commonly referred to as the Spring Festival in China, says Chinese teacher Lucia Hu. According to the Chinese lunar festival, the new year celebration, which generally lasts 15 days, began this year on February 18.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070222151401.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left><BR>Ms. Hu explained to the students the legend of the spring festival during a special presentation in the school?s field house on Wednesday, February 21. This special buddy event featured a parade in which students in pre-school through grade 8 participated.<BR><BR>?The spring festival is the most important and biggest festival in China,? she said. ?To the Chinese people, it is at least as important as Christmas is to people in the West. It is the first day of the lunar calendar and usually occurs somewhere between January 30 and February 20. This festival heralds the beginning of spring. It is also a festival of reunion. No matter how far away people are from their homes, they will try their best to get back home to celebrate a reunion dinner.?<BR><BR>The origin of the Chinese New Year festival can be traced back thousands of years. According to one of the most famous legends, in ancient China there lived a ferocious monster named Year. Year lived deep at the bottom of the sea all year round and climbed up to the shore only on New Year?s Eve to devour the cattle and kill the people. People in the villages would flee to remote mountains so as to avoid this disaster. One year, an old man offered the villagers an option to fleeing. His solution was to put bright red paper on all of the villagers? doors and to fill their homes with noise. That is why on New Year?s Eve each family sticks antithetical couplets written on red paper on their doors, blows up firecrackers, and keeps their houses brilliantly illuminated while they stay up late into the night.<BR><BR>The Academy students made plenty of noise in honor of this traditional Chinese celebration. In addition, they were treated to a dance of the dragon courtesy of dancers from the Golden Dragon on Mack Avenue. ?We really appreciate the authentic flavor that Yee Tom from the Golden Dragon was able to provide for the children,? said third grade teacher Jeanette Stepanek, who coordinates the school?s buddy program and organized the making of masks and paper dragons for the event.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070223170450.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070223170507.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070223170521.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>What kind of road salt keeps water from freezing best: calcium chloride or sodium chloride? How does the amount of yeast affect the thickness of a pizza crust? How does the temperature of a puck affect the distance it travels? A balloon will pop when it is pressed against a single nail. Why doesn?t it pop when it is pressed against a large group of nails? <BR><BR>This represents just a few of the questions posed by young scientists at The Grosse Pointe Academy during the third annual Grade 4/5 Science Fair. The project, which began in January when students formulated their questions and hypotheses, culminated in an evening event on March 14 when parents had the opportunity to view the display boards in the performing arts wing corridor and library while students were on hand to explain their methods and procedures.<BR><BR>4/5 teachers Vivek Nayak and Bob Lapadot led the project during science classes. They began by teaching the scientific method (stating the problem, forming a hypothesis, identifying and controlling the variables, listing the materials and procedures, recording observations, and forming a conclusion). Work for the projects was completed both at home and at school.<BR><BR>Middle school science teachers Michael Fultz, Wendy Jewett and Michelle Roberts, along with retired science and math teacher Mac Jones, judged the projects, awarding certificates of outstanding achievement to the top projects in each grade. Certificates were awarded to (top photo, from left)&nbsp;fourth graders Joseph Cavataio, Michael Schaller, George Spica, Jared Brush and R.J. McCarren; and (bottom photo, from left) fifth graders Michael Blake, Luiza Wasilewski, and Karstan Minanov.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grosse Pointe Academy eighth grade girls attended a girls-only science and math exploration symposium at Detroit Country Day School on Wednesday, April 3. Sponsored by the Cranbrook Institute of Science, Detroit Country Day and Ford Motor Company, the event was attended by over 900 girls from 22 area schools. During the course of the morning and early afternoon, attendees had the opportunity to sign up for three workshops, the purpose of which was to expose them to a broad range of career opportunities for women.<BR><BR>A favorite workshop of several of the Academy girls focused on a product many of us take for granted: plastic. According to Alice Flood, Libby Krueger, Keegin Fisher, Emily Spica and Maddie Miriani, all of whom attended this workshop, the purpose was to show how much plastics are incorporated into everyday life. They conducted experiments with plastic, saw a shirt made out of water bottles, learned how plastics can be recycled&nbsp;for environmental purposes,&nbsp;and listened to a representative from Daimler-Chrysler who talked about the use of plastic for auto parts.<BR><BR>The workshops opened the girls' eyes to how many careers are available to them, from engineering to opthalmology to veterinary science to marine biology. Rachel Ochylski and Maddie Miriani participated in a mock trial in a workshop on the environment and the law. Emily Skau and Mia Jefferson learned what it would be like to adapt to life without a limb in a workshop on orthopedics and prosthetics. Julia Rose O'Hara and Sarah Whitaker&nbsp;built a bridge on the computer, competing to see who could successfully get a truck across the bridge for the least amount of money. In "Lasers and Lenses," Taylor Bell learned how algebra is involved in creating prescriptions for glasses and contact lenses. Allie Fowler, Libby Krueger and Alice Flood learned about veterinary medicine for exotic animals. Other workshops with titles like "Astronomy: The Real Cosmo Girl," "Space Invaders" and "Inside the Computer Behind the Blue Screen" taught about how astronomy and astrology differ, how plants and animals were transported to the United States from other countries, and how to take PCs apart and identify the different parts.<BR><BR>The workshops offered the girls an inside look at and hands-on approach to many exciting careers available to women,&nbsp;all of which&nbsp;incorporate many of the skills they are learning today in their math and science classes. For example, from biology class with Mr. Fultz, Rachel Ochylski was able to successfully identify many of the fish in a workshop on "Bugs and Thugs of the Great Lakes." The students took quizzes, participated in competitions, conducted experiments and participated in mock surveys and trials. At the end of the day, they compared notes, discussing their favorite workshops&nbsp;and which they liked the least. Perhaps the most important lesson they learned was how many practical applications there are to math and science and how their knowledge of these subject areas will allow them to successfully compete in a variety of careers. This is a lesson that would make their math and science teachers, Wendy Jewett and Michelle Roberts, who accompanied the girls to the symposium, very proud.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>On March 15, Director of Technology Robert Rochte launched a small helium balloon carrying a GPS tracker from the school parking lot. Later that morning, four fifth graders (below, from left: Kate Krueger, Joe DiMauro, Will Scarfone and Robbie Triano) accompanied Robert to the MACUL conference at Cobo Hall, with the goal of displaying live tracking of the balloon. Unfortunately, the GPS tracker failed, so the students resorted to discussing their upcoming solar Montgolfiere (hot air balloon) project, using the display board fifth graders created last year. The balloon ultimately landed in New Brunswick - over 900 miles away!</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070416135330.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>The balloon launch was a kick-off for the 4/5 solar balloon project. Computer classes throughout April will focus on the real-world use of Excel to design a stratospheric solar Montgolfiere - and students will fly the balloon by the end of the month, using the Internet to track the balloon?s progress and Microsoft Word and PowerPoint to document the project.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=#000000>The drop-off circle and playground area were bustling with activity on Friday, as Academy sixth graders collected recyclables during a paper drive and lower school children cleaned up litter in the playground, all in honor of Earth Day this Sunday, April 22. The weather cooperated, bringing sunshine and warmth to aid in the students' endeavors.<BR><BR>For the recycling drive, every student who brought in a bag of paper received a chocolate coin as a token of appreciation, with the class that collected the most winning a class treat. Withi the help of Ms. Jewett's sixth and seventh grade math classes, Mrs. Whitaker and the sixth grade students were able to estimate the weight of the collected paper. The estimated total was close to 3,500 pounds! Almost every class contributed to the drive and the amounts collected per class ranged from 5 lbs to nearly 1,600 lbs. Mrs. Varty's class brought in the most amount of paper from the Early School.<BR><BR>Says Harriett Whitaker: "At the start, it was a close race between Mrs. Wolney, Mrs. Thomas, Mrs. Karle and Mr. Lapadot's classes. We thought Mrs. Karle's class had it in the bag with the McCuish family load. However, Mrs. Mobley brought in two carloads full of medical magazines and journals, helping Mr. Lapadot's class pull ahead to win!"<BR><BR>The sixth graders will treat Mr. Lapadot's class to a special celebration.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070420113717.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>Lower School students "did an awesome job," according to Barbara Karle, in their clean-up project during recess.

		<title>Spectators Spellbound at GPA Spelling Bee</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Documentaries have been made about them. Novels have been written about them and subsequently made into movies. The subject matter ? spelling bees ? may seem an unlikely source for high drama, but on Friday, April 20, a drama unfolded in the guise of The Grosse Pointe Academy annual spelling bee. The participants were finalists from grades 5 through 8. The audience was made up of fourth and fifth grade students and a handful of parents. According to fifth grade teacher Bob Lapadot, this year?s bee was the most intense he has witnessed in&nbsp;the 20 years&nbsp;he has served&nbsp;as school spelling bee moderator.&nbsp;The event lasted a record number of 88 rounds (last year?s bee, also a record, was only 22 rounds) and an unprecedented two hours, during which time the young audience of fourth and fifth graders sat spellbound.</P><P>Fifth grader Zachary Wood made it to the final three in his debut performance, but the final match-up came between defending champion Somers Brush and last year?s runner-up Alex Parker, both seventh graders. When Somers and Alex depleted the original spelling list provided to the judges, middle school principal Scott Tily was forced to delay the proceedings and run to his office to download a list of additional words. The finalists agreed that if they got through this list of 23 words without a clear champion, they would declare a draw. With four words remaining, Somers was given the word ?camouflage.?&nbsp; According to the rules declared at the beginning of the bee, a finalist in the final rounds between two participants is only eliminated if he or she incorrectly spells a word that his or her opponent is then able to spell correctly, along with the next word on the list. When Somers misspelled the word, Alex was able to come up with the correct spelling. The next word on the list ? which Alex needed to spell correctly to win ? was ?tedious.? ?Can you use that in a sentence?? Alex asked. ?Spelling bees can be very tedious,? quipped Mr. Lapadot. Alex spelled the word correctly and was declared the champion. </P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070430100721.jpg" border=0></P><P>Congratulations go to all the top spellers in their grades who qualified for the bee based on a written test. The other finalists in addition to Alex and Somers were fifth graders Karstan Minanov, Allison Mobley, Camille Ragland, Will Scarfone, Kate Van Pelt and Zachary Wood; sixth graders Dylan Demkowicz, Liam McIlroy, Giovanna Posselius, Steven Ragland, Gerard Smith and Chandler Warren; seventh graders Samantha Fitzpatrick, Grace Rentschler and Samantha Sternad; and eighth graders Taylor Bell, Madeline Miriani, Evan Schwartz and Emily Skau. <BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Alexis Stepanek ?04 received a Scholastic National Gold Medal and her artwork will be included in the National Student Art Show this summer. The National Student Art Show is sponsored by the Alliance of Young Artists and Writers. Scholastic Art Awards is the oldest and most prestigious competition in the nation for young artists and writers.<BR><BR>Alexis?s piece, ?New York, New York,? chosen from 17,000 pieces submitted nationwide, is among the 260 Gold Medals awarded nationally. Only 350 pieces will be exhibited in the National Student Art Show. Alexis is invited for a four-day event in New York City, which includes an awards ceremony at Carnegie Hall, an awards dinner, and three days of workshops, visits to artists? studios, and behind-the-scenes visits to museums.<BR><BR>Alexis?s love for photography goes back for as long as she can remember. Her interest in art blossomed when she was in middle school at The Grosse Pointe Academy, and a particularly strong influence was art teacher Bryan Zink. ?Art class with Mr. Zink helped me a lot in finding different ways to approach things,? she says. It was then that she got interested in art as more than just a hobby.<BR><BR>Alexis has pursued a variety of art classes at Grosse Pointe South, where she is currently a junior. In addition to photography, she has enrolled in classes in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics and communication design. She is interested in taking her interest further in college, perhaps exploring documentary photography or photojournalism.<BR><BR>In addition, Alexis has taken classes at the Center for Creative Studies in digital photography, figure drawing and glass blowing. ?The glass blowing didn?t work out too well,? she admits. ?It was extremely difficult.? Over spring break in April, Alexis made arrangements with the Detroit News to job shadow two photojournalists over the course of two days. In addition, examples of her work, including the piece ?New York, New York,? were on display at South?s spring art show.<BR><BR>Having started her education at the Academy when she was four, Alexis credits her elementary school years for providing her with a well-rounded education, which included involvement in athletics. She participated on middle school cross country, basketball, volleyball and soccer teams. She continued with cross country at South, and has carried over her interest in volleyball as an assistant coach at GPA. She and fellow alumna Anna Basse have coached the Academy JV teams for the past two years. ?It?s been a lot of fun,? says Alexis. ?The girls are great to work with and very upbeat.?<BR><BR>As a recent graduate of the Academy, Alexis has the following advice to share with this year?s eighth graders: ?Don?t be shy. Get out and do the best you can,? she says. ?Don?t stress out that you went to a small school if you are going to a bigger high school. Get involved and do what you can and stick with it.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>For the first time, Grosse Pointe Academy middle school students participated in the National French Contest (also known as <EM>Le Grand Concours</EM>) as part of the French curriculum. This 60-minute national examination is developed and managed by the American Association of Teachers of French. Its purpose is to help stimulate further interest in the teaching and learning of French as well as to help identify and reward student achievement.<BR><BR>The exam is a multiple-choice test of approximately 70 items covering listening comprehension, vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Students took the test that was appropriate for the French curriculum in which they are currently enrolled. Their scores were then ranked against students locally as well as nationally who are enrolled in similar curricula.<BR><BR>Seventh and eighth graders were recognized who scored in the top 50th and the top 20th percentiles within the Detroit metropolitan region.&nbsp; Sixth graders were recognized at the national level only. The following students scored in the top 50th percentile: Emmy Boccaccio (grade 7), Lexie Fisher (grade 7), Libby Krueger (grade 8) and Evan Schwartz ( grade 8). The following&nbsp; students, all of whom are seventh graders, scored in the top 20th percentile: Samantha Fitzpatrick, Anne Flick and Robert Stanley.<BR><BR>Five students were named National Medal Winners. The winners in the sixth grade category are Kate Wacker, Morgan Westwood and Katherine Woodward. The National Medal Winners in the seventh/eighth grade category are Somers Brush and Grace Rentschler.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070529100323.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left>"Winning a national medal is quite a feat," said French teacher Judyth Stayton, who teaches students in grades 4-8. "It was very gratifying to have so many students achieve this, especially since this was the first time the Academy has participated in this contest."<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The topic was marketing. The presenter was Lisa Vallee-Smith, CEO and founder of Airfoil, a public relations firm based in Detroit that specializes in marketing and public relations services for some of the world?s most prominent technology, consumer, automotive and healthcare companies.<BR><BR>The audience, however, was not executives from Fortune 500 companies, but rather Academy seventh graders who were about to embark upon a marketing project of their own for social studies class with Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Whitaker. Divided into groups and assigned African countries, the students? challenge is to market those countries to travel agents using two tools: a brochure and a display booth.<BR><BR>The project is due at the end of May, and Ms. Vallee-Smith&nbsp;grouped the project requirements into manageable phases within a timeline: 1) research (study it), 2) plan and design (plan it), 3) create, write and design (shape it), 4) execute, rehearse and present (put it to work), and 5) evaluate (reflect).<BR><BR>?You start with content and research and build on that,? Ms. Vallee-Smith explained. She went on to describe different forms of marketing research, from primary research (or ?research that doesn?t already exist ? you can?t buy it or access it on the Internet?) to secondary research ? i.e., research that already exists on web sites, etc. Ms. Vallee-Smith advised the students to start with primary research. ?Talk to a travel agent,? she said. ?Find out what they want, what associations they belong to, what they read and where they get their information.? They would then continue their research via the Internet.<BR><BR>Ms. Vallee-Smith left the students with two pieces of key advice. ?Know your audience,? she said. ?And come up with three key messages you want your clients to know about your country.?<BR><BR>As a member of the Academy Board of Trustees who serves on the Executive Committee as well as co-chairs the Marketing Committee, Ms. Vallee-Smith shares her marketing expertise not only with Academy students, but with Academy administrators and staff members as well.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>"Each one of us has a journey to take and the possibilities are endless."<BR><BR>Academy first, second and third graders explored many musical possibilities during the Lower School music program on Wednesday, April 25.

Approximately 300 third through fifth graders from the Academy, University Liggett School and Richard Elementary School participated, with several children drawing ads for one of approximately 700 businesses. The winning ad for each business is published in this section along with the first name of the child and his or her school and grade.<BR><BR>"This was tough to judge," said Grosse Pointe News advertising manager Peter Birkner. "For many businesses several ads were excellent and it was a difficult choice to make. We'd like to thank all the children and teachers who participated in this project. We hope this was&nbsp;a learning experience for you and helps you to understand a little more about advertising and newspapers."<BR><BR>A percentage of the profits will be donated back to the participating schools.<BR><BR>Special thanks go to K-3 art teacher Rosi Triano and 4-8 art teacher Bryan Zink for working with the students on this project.</FONT></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=#000000>Second grade teacher Devin Williams hosted her final parent breakfast for the year the week before school ended. Parents brought a blanket and a picnic basket and gathered on the Lakeshore lawn to enjoy readings by each of the children of the stories they had written and illustrated in hardbound books.<BR><BR>"I started the monthly parent breakfast to bring parents and students together so they could see what has been going on in our classroom," Devin explained. "We usually show the parents something we have been working on or have a little assignment that parents and students work on together during breakfast. It has been wonderful and I feel that parents really appreciate knowing how their child is doing on a regular basis."<BR><BR>For this final breakfast of the year, Devin enlisted the support of parent Jennifer Bojarczyk to help with planning. Jennifer came up with the idea of a picnic on the front lawn and gave it a patriotic theme with shiny hats and a flag cake. The children had been working hard&nbsp;over the past two months&nbsp;writing and illustrating their own books, tying together everything they learned over the year in grammar, spelling, writing, proofreading and reading.&nbsp;Devin started the project by conducting a writing workshop in which she worked with small groups of children to help them organize their ideas onto paper.&nbsp;The students went on to write rough drafts. Devin then asked fifth grade teacher Bob Lapadot if he would be interested in having his students mentor the second graders in editing their drafts. Over a series of four 45-minute sessions, each second grader worked with a fifth grade peer editor who gave him or her individualized attention.<BR><BR>"It was wonderful watching them work together," Devin said. "I believe peer editors make the best teachers! The fifth graders helped them with spelling, punctuation, and even illustrations." Many of the second graders dedicated their books to their fifth grade buddy.<BR><BR>Since the fifth graders were such a great help to the younger students, Devin invited them to the breakfast. Bob Lapadot brought his famous punch and fruit kabobs to help the children celebrate. Said Bob of the experience: "It was amazing witnessing first-hand what Devin has accomplished with these children. The quality of writing was outstanding."</FONT></P><P align=center><FONT color=#000000><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070521134412.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left></FONT></P>]]></content:encoded>

While the seventh graders&nbsp;tested their&nbsp;physical skills&nbsp;at Camp Storer and the eighth graders took in the sights on their Cleveland trip, the sixth graders ruled the land with the annual sixth grade medieval feast.<BR><BR>Organized by social studies teachers Harriett Whitaker and Mary Jo Johnson, the event has become a popular tradition among the students. Parents, or "serving wenches," served a first course of bread, soup and pears, a second course of chicken, roast potatoes and baby carrots, and a final course of dessert. In between courses, King Michael (Fultz) and Queen Harriett (Whitaker) and an assortment of guests that included a priest, lords and ladies of the manor,&nbsp;knights and squires, all seated according to their status, enjoyed a knighthood, entertainment by musicians, dancers, jugglers, poets, jesters and even a yo-yo artist, and several judgments during which folks in the gallery decide whether an evildoer should be set free or sent to the dungeon.</FONT></P><P align=center><FONT color=#000000><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070521134500.jpg" border=0><BR></FONT></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>GPA Opens Renovated School Building</title>
		<link>http://www.gpacademy.org/news/gpa-opens-renovated-school-building/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>On Tuesday, September 4, The Grosse Pointe Academy opened the doors of the main school building to students for the first time since the building closed for construction at the end of the 2005-06 school year. Students and parents in grades 1-8 arrived for orientation that day prior to the start of school on Wednesday, September 5. While tours of construction in progress were offered last spring, many families were seeing the renovated school building for the first time.</P><P>What can Academy parents and students expect from the $7.8 million project? For starters, according to Head of School Phil Demartini, they will walk into classrooms that are 200 to 250 square feet larger than their predecessors. They can also expect to see classrooms updated with running water and a drinking fountain (for grades 1-5), ample storage space, and new cabinetry and lighting, all of which contribute to an optimal learning environment. For example, the fluorescent lights have pendent fixtures and offer even light with no glare, along with quiet electronic ballasts and multiple light level controls in the classroom.</P><P>?In planning the building, we always looked to the latest research on education and what would create the best environment for teachers and students,? says Demartini.</P><P>The challenge of the project, according to Demartini, was modernizing an old historic building and bringing it into the 21st century while at the same time preserving the building?s character. ?The architects and builders (Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc. and Frank Rewold and Son, Inc.) always kept our capital campaign theme ? Tradition and Tomorrow ? in mind,? says Demartini.&nbsp; Two prime examples of combining the past and the future, according to capital campaign co-chair Cathy Broderick, are the library and the third floor art loft. ?The third floor is such a surprise,? says Broderick. ?The floor was completely gutted and the architects had the most freedom up there to create a space that is truly an inspiration.?</P><P>The library, located on the second floor, is a cornerstone of the renovations. It has retained the character of a traditional library, with cathedral ceilings and wooden rafters, arched windows and dark wood shelving, while incorporating modern-day technology through the addition of two catalog computers and six computers for student use in conducting on-line research. Young children have a cozy area of their own in the back for reading time.</P><P>?From the first time I entered the space that used to be the old auditorium, I knew in my mind and heart that this would be ?The Library,?? says Theo Pappas, AIA, Executive Director/Principal in Charge - Fanning Howey. ?To see a space realized to its full potential, as a symbol of learning and knowledge, as an aesthetic affirmation of the tenets of education, has been a sheer joy to me as an architect.?</P><P>The building features the school?s original windows and doors, which were refurbished during the renovations. In addition, the original Welsh tile in the main hallway, which was protected during construction, has been restored, waxed and polished. Visitors to the school will be greeted at a glassed-in reception area in the front quad. The first floor houses first through fifth grade classrooms, with two classrooms for each. Each classroom has ample space for class sizes of 15 to 16, and the newly installed elevator was designed to accommodate that class size as well.</P><P>The second floor is a dedicated Middle School space, with the exception of the library and computer lab, which will be shared by all grades. One side houses the humanities ? social studies and language arts ? while the other side contains science and math classrooms in addition to fully equipped, state-of-the-art science labs, one for middle school chemistry and physics and one for environmental science (grades 1-5) and biology (grade 6). In addition to computers for student use in each classroom (two per lower school classroom, four per 4/5 classroom and three per middle school classroom), there are 18 computers in the computer lab. Finally, every classroom is equipped with a plasma TV that can be hooked up to the teacher?s computer for classroom instruction.</P><P>In the third floor loft, architects Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc. made very inventive use of the existing space to create ample room for lower school and middle school art studios, a kiln room, and a spacious supply area along with classrooms for foreign language (Spanish, French and Chinese) and Christian Life. The original beams were preserved and what once posed obstacles are now integrated into the design. Natural light from windows and skylights along with track lighting in the corridor create a bright, airy space where student artwork can be displayed and students are free to express their creativity.</P><P>?The upper level, or ?attic? as it used to be called, is my favorite and was great fun to design,? says Pappas. ?In the spirit of a French ?garret? or atelier, the studio concept was the best application to this floor level because it released the natural light of the original skylights to be enjoyed by all, and the walls were liberated to allow the spaces to work much better and provide a higher quality environment.?</P><P>Pappas applauds the school?s Board, administration and staff for championing the preservation of an historic building. ?It is rare to see a group of parents and educators who are bold enough to understand that change is the requisite in order to prepare our children for success in the future. One of the main goals was to breathe life into the building, by restoration of its primary historic elements and motifs, allowing their richness and details to once again permeate one?s experience of the building. What a wonderful way to celebrate the investment of those who gave so much before us, while ensuring that the building will continue to serve children of a generation yet born. This project represents preservation of values, preservation of generations, and preservation of tradition.?<BR><BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>This summer, Academy classroom teachers from the Early School through grade 5 took time from their summer vacations to learn F.A.S.T. reading techniques.<BR><BR>F.A.S.T. is a synthesis of whole language and phonetic instructional techniques that is designed to help students break the phonetic code while involving them in meaningful reading and writing from the first day of the program. The program is unique and especially effective because it teaches students key phonetic concepts and then immediately reinforces those concepts with practice in phonetically controlled reading materials that are age and interest appropriate. It awakens students to the wonder, excitement and joy of reading. It is founded in scientific brain research and the best practices of reading instruction.<BR><BR>Last winter, Wendy Demartini, Marsha Thomas and Denise Phelps participated in the four-day training session led by Steve Tattum, founder of F.A.S.T. They immediately applied these techniques in a two-pronged manner. Wendy Demartini used the program in her fourth grade classroom and Denise Phelps used this approach with individual students and small groups of children. ?In all situations, the impact was immediate and amazing,? says Denise. ?It complements any existing Grosse Pointe Academy program and helps students across the learning spectrum. Children who are already good readers became better readers as they increased their speed and comprehension.?<BR><BR>F.A.S.T. techniques are unique because they can be implemented on an individual level and in the classroom. Both Wendy and Denise worked intensely this summer with Steve Tattum to achieve a higher level of certification that will allow them to support The Grosse Pointe Academy?s trained faculty and their students. The Academy was a leader for regional schools in July when it hosted two training sessions for teachers. Several other schools in the area are introducing F.A.S.T. techniques into their programs, including Detroit Country Day School, Star of the Sea and the Grosse Pointe Public School System.<BR><BR>The techniques? successes are highlighted by two GPA students, Derek and Jared Demkowicz. Both were doing well in their classes but were slow readers who needed to improve their comprehension and speed. After two weeks, Derek was able to learn many techniques to boost his confidence in reading.Jared had similar results and more than doubled his reading speed while increasing his understanding of text.<BR><BR>?What we found was that all kids benefit from the F.A.S.T. reading program,? said their mother, Connie.?We are extremely excited that the Academy has implemented techniques that will benefit every type of reader.?<BR><BR>Sally Bollenbacher, mother of Richard&nbsp; second grader Garrett, adds the following anecdote:&nbsp; ?When we got in the car Garrett said, ?That was so fun. Can I do it again? I can?t believe that I thought it was going to be a disaster. It was like heaven.??</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>GPA students kicked off this year's Fall Spirit Night on Tuesday with their buddies during a pep rally in the morning, many of them meeting their buddies for the first time. Later that day PCC volunteers cooked up hot dogs for families, while GPA fans cheered on the cross country, boys' soccer and boys' tennis teams. A few sprinkles and rumbles of thunder did not dampen spirits or thin the crowd, and all games were able to be played to completion in spite of the questionable weather. GPA girls came in second in the cross country meet and the boys' tennis team beat the previously undefeated Hillel 7 to 5.<BR><BR>Making a special appearance during Spirit Night was the Scholastic Book Fair mascot, a polar bear, who reminded students and their parents about the blizzard of books coming soon to GPA.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070928100151.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20070928100221.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

However, seventh grader Brion Flick came in 7th place overall.</P><P>The 7/8 girls' team trophy went to St. Joan of Arc.&nbsp;The Grosse Pointe Academy came in second place, with Lauren Schaller, Somers Brush, and Abigail Boll well on the heels of St. Joan.</P><P>The 5/6 boys' team trophy went to the Academy of the Sacred Heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 5/6 GPA boys' team came in third place.&nbsp;Robbie Triano, Zachary Wood, and Will Hamer helped us secure our position in third place.</P><P>Finally, the 5/6 girls' team trophy went to ASH as well.&nbsp;Again, the Academy came in third place, with Samantha Perry, Sabrina Gamble, and Jennifer Vermet securing our third place victory.</P><P>Said Coach Nayak: "Our team is getting much better!&nbsp;They understand how to pace themselves and how to run on different types of terrain and landforms. In addition, they are getting a better understanding of their opponents and what it takes to defeat them in a race.&nbsp;Finally, they understand when they must accelerate to get past their opponents.&nbsp;On Wednesday, I saw my team use these components to their advantage.&nbsp;I am very happy to see that our team is growing and learning as time goes on."</P><P>Coach Nayak&nbsp;recognized Brion Flick, Lauren Schaller, Somers Brush, Abigail Boll, and Kate Wacker for running in the Invitational.&nbsp;Said Vivek: "Although these students were not on the team this year, they are veteran cross-country runners, and helped us out greatly!"</P><P>Vivek also gave special recognition to&nbsp;Jennifer Vermet, who has improved a great deal.&nbsp;Jennifer came in third place for the GPA 5/6 girls' team with a time of 15 minutes and 42 seconds.

It has retained the character of a traditional library, with cathedral ceilings and wooden rafters, arched windows and dark wood shelving, while incorporating modern-day technology through the addition of two catalog computers and six computers for student use in conducting on-line research. Young children have a cozy area of their own in the back for reading time.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20071018152431.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20071018152449.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20071018152505.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20071018152939.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

("There are no losers when it comes to reading," said librarian Jane Baetens, who coordinated the contest.)<BR><BR>Recognition certificates were awarded to students who read over 500 or 1500 pages. Recognition certificates will continue to be awarded throughout the year. "We want our students to continue to take time to read," said Jane. "Our goal was not to beat them - our goal was to encourage a lifelong love of reading.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The Academy advantage goes beyond the strong academic foundation each child receives. It lies in the sense of community at the heart of the school, and in the personal touch and individualized attention that is the hallmark of quality teaching and drives individual achievement. It begins at morning arrival, when the Head of School, a principal or a fifth grader personally opens the door for each child, extending a greeting and a smile; and it continues well beyond the close of the school day with an AfterCare program for working families and such after-school activities as intramural and interscholastic sports, chess club and cooking class. It is fostered by the buddy program, for example, in which younger students are matched with older students to march together in the vocabulary parade, do a community service project, or simply share a book on the school lawn. It is enriched by the ethical, moral and spiritual development students receive at Monday morning chapel assemblies, Christian Life class, and Early School "peace corners," and by an atmosphere that welcomes and respects all religious beliefs and cultures. It is furthered by a&nbsp;tuition assistance&nbsp;program that makes an Academy education <A href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/103.html" target=_blank>affordable. </A></P><P align=left>The Academy advantage continues into high school, college and beyond, when graduates, equipped with a strong academic foundation, solid study skills, and firm character growth, continue to excel in their chosen areas of study and to grow as decent, caring human beings who have developed during their early education a true desire for learning, and a core sense of confidence and personal purpose.</P><P align=left><STRONG>The Academy advantages include:</STRONG></P><P align=left><FONT color=steelblue><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Certified Montessori Early School for ages 2 1/2 to 5</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Lower and Middle Schools Grades 1-8</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Small class size with individualized instruction</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Recently renovated school building with media center, state-of-the-art science labs, new computer lab and third floor art loft</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG>&nbsp;</FONT>Tuition assistance&nbsp;program</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Foreign language offerings (French from age 3; Spanish and Chinese from Grade 4)</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>All teachers in Early School through grade 5 trained in F.A.S.T. reading techniques</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Environmental science curriculum</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Christian Life program</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Array of arts offerings including creative movement, visual arts, and a variety of performance opportunities</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Leadership and community service opportunities for Middle School students</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=black>Int</FONT>erscholastic athletics including soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, boys? lacrosse and cross country</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Recognition of academic achievements for Middle School students through academic awards assembly and National Junior Honor Society induction ceremony </P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Geographic, ethnic, religious and socioeconomic diversity</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>20-acre campus with lakeside setting</P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Before and after school activities including strings, chess club and intramural sports </P><P align=left><FONT color=#4682b4><STRONG>.</STRONG> </FONT>Before and After Care programs</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Many families who might otherwise be interested in an independent school do not seek out this option due to cost. The value of a Grosse Pointe Academy education cannot be measured in dollars, but in the future successes of our graduates in high school, college and beyond. An investment in a Grosse Pointe Academy education provides an advantage that lasts a lifetime.</P><P>The Academy prides itself in offering these advantages through outstanding academics, a unique approach to education, a Christian way of life,&nbsp;a wide range&nbsp;of extracurricular activities to challenge both the mind and the body - from chess to interscholastic athletics - and a lakeside setting with unparalleled facilities. However, tuition revenue alone does not cover this level of excellence. To keep tuition affordable, the school relies on other revenue sources such as annual and capital giving, Action Auction, and endowment interest. As an independent school, the Academy does not receive funding from local, state and federal governments.</P><P>The Grosse Pointe Academy seeks out many ways to make an Academy education affordable to as many families as possible. For 2007-08, the Academy has awarded $535,000 in tuition assistance. In fact, in grades 1-8, 29% of students receive some form of tuition assistance. This includes both need-based and merit-based scholarships. In addition, finance plans are available to meet budgeting needs.</P><P>For more information about affording the Academy, please contact the Admissions Office at 313-886-1221 or e-mail Molly McDermott at <A href="mailto:mmcdermott@gpacademy.org">mmcdermott@gpacademy.org</A>.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>School counselor and staff consultant Sean Hogan-Downey, A.C.S.W., led a discussion on Thursday on the book <EM>Loser</EM>, by Jerry Spinelli, for 4/5 students and their parents. During this breakfast/book group discussion, students and parents&nbsp;compared notes on why many of the protagonist's peers perceived him as a "loser."<BR><BR>"Because he doesn't excel in anything," said one fourth grader. "He has bad handwriting and he gets bad grades and he's not good in sports."<BR><BR>"If Zinkoff was such a loser and nobody liked him, why is it then that we liked him?" asked Sean.<BR><BR>"Because we're reading the book from his point of view," replied a fifth grader.<BR><BR><FONT color=#333333>The students focused on the perspective of the protagonist and ways they could help if they saw a peer being bullied.<BR><BR>"I call that being a bystander," said Sean. "Being a bystander means you're not the victim or the perpetrator, but you can take an active part. I'm not suggesting that you take on the bully. That's for the adults to do. But you can distract the bully and say to the victim, 'Here, you come with me.'"</FONT><FONT color=#333333><BR><BR>Sean also discussed the "big eyes" that children develop around fifth grade, when they become more critical of their peers. Oftentimes that criticism can result in name calling and other mean behavior.<BR><BR>The students and parents agreed on some <FONT color=#333333>life lessons they would take away from the book. "I will try not to be judgmental," said a fifth grader.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT color=#333333>"I used to worry about how others would perceive or judge my children," said a&nbsp;parent. "Now I know it's okay for them to be different and I accept them for who they are. They are so much happier that way."</FONT></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P align=left><FONT color=#000000>In February, as part of a social studies unit, fourth and fifth graders will turn back the clock and experience what school was like for children back in the early 1900s. They will visit the second floor of the Provencal-Weir House, which has been transformed into a one-room schoolhouse, circa 1900, complete with benches, individual chalkboards and McGuffy Readers.<BR><BR>The boys and girls will dress in old-fashioned costumes on the day of their field trip. The girls will wear long skirts with blouses and sweaters or shawls, and the boys will wear pants with socks pulled over them to resemble knickers. The finishing touch will be the vests and the bonnets the students sewed on Friday (with the help of some willing parents) to lend a special authenticity to their trip.</FONT></P><P align=center><FONT color=#000000><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080125172814.jpg" border=0></FONT></P><P align=center><FONT color=#000000><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080125172827.jpg" border=0></P><P align=left></FONT></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Middle school students at The Grosse Pointe Academy have a cure for the February blahs: it?s called Spirit Week. Students showed their school spirit by dressing according to a theme and participating in a variety of fun, challenging and just plain silly competitions. For example, sixth, seventh and eighth graders tested their mental acumen during a trivia contest during Clash Day, challenged their endurance and physical fortitude by scootering, hula hooping, and hopping their way through an obstacle course during Pajama Day, and exhibited their creativity and team-building skills in a wall decorating contest during Class Theme Day, which was beach day for the sixth grade, the 70?s for the seventh grade, and video games for the eighth grade. A culminating activity was dodge ball with students against the teachers.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214113244.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214113302.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214113317.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214113335.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214131843.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214131911.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214131925.jpg" border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Roselie Bellanca Posselius?s association with the Academy began over forty years ago, when her parents brought her for her admissions interview to what was then the Academy of the Sacred Heart. She was going into first grade. Four years later she was a part of a major transition in the school?s history.<BR><BR>Recalls Roselie: ?I was entering the fifth grade when the school became The Grosse Pointe Academy. It was so exciting! The faculty was for the most part new, and there were boys, which was a major shock to the system. The school had just been saved by a group of parents led by Carole Peabody and Toni Robinson, and there was this incredible energy generated toward making it all work. The group was dedicated to carrying on the mission of the Sacred Heart in a new way.? Several of the teachers who came that year are still at GPA today, including Marion Chrisner, Mary Jo Johnson and Scott Tily.<BR><BR>After graduating from the Academy, Roselie attended high school at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Bloomfield Hills. She received her bachelor?s degree from St. Mary?s College and an M.F.A. from Pratt Institute in New York City. She reconnected with the Academy in 1987 when her close friend and GPA classmate, Catherine O?Brien McCuish, asked her to join the Alumni Association Board. Roselie went on to serve on the Board for the next six years, the last four as president.<BR><BR>In 1988, she married another Academy alum, Peter Posselius ?72, representing the first marriage of GPA alums.<BR><BR>After having served the school for so long on a volunteer basis, Roselie returned in 2000 in a new role as a parent when her daughter, Giovanna, entered kindergarten. In 2003 she rejoined the Alumni Association Board and has served for the past five years as president. Next year will conclude yet another term of leadership on the Alumni Association. She is proud of the Association?s many accomplishments, such as raising funds for two partial scholarships, the Helen Healy Scholarship and the Alumni Scholarship, both of which are given to the child or grandchild of an alum. The Alumni Association also hosts the Day of Recollection, All Saints? Day mass, Christmas Eve mass, Blessing of the Babies, among other events, and contributes to the Annual Fund and Action Auction. Several years ago Roselie coordinated an Alumni History Day for the students, which she hopes to repeat every three or four years, and in the last two years the Association has gotten current<BR>families and young alums involved with such events as the Alumni Association Halloween Party.<BR><BR>?Our goal is to have a more visible presence in the school so that current students know who we are and can continue the tradition. After all, they are the future caretakers of this school.?<BR><BR>Roselie reflects on her experiences at the Academy as follows. ?The Academy gave me a really strong foundation on which to build. I was prepared academically, I felt supported by everyone there, and I am very grateful for the fact that I have always felt that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. I credit the Academy for that feeling.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Congratulations go to the following students who received the top scores in this year's Continental Math League (CML) competition: second graders Grace Andreasen, Sophie Leslie, Karina Minanov, and Spencer Warezak, third grader David Scupholm, fourth grader Alexander Minanov, fifth grader R.J. McCarren, sixth grader Caleb Cimmarrusti, seventh grader Jeffrey Woolstrum, and eighth grader Katarina Goitz.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080418143915.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>The Continental Math League is a nationally sponsored mathematical competition. Hundreds of schools and thousands of students around the country participate. Students are challenged to solve six difficult problems in thirty minutes. Each correct answer is worth one point. The problems are designed to encourage students to use a variety of problem solving techniques in the areas of mathematical and visual problem solving.<BR><BR>This was the third year that Academy students in grades 2-8 have participated. Grades 2 and 3 have three meets while grades 4-8 have five meets. The top scores at each grade are sent to the CML headquarters in New Jersey.<BR><BR>"The world of math is changing," said 4/5 teacher Wendy Demartini, who, as Curriculum Coordinator, brought the CML competition to the Academy several years ago. "It used to be that rote repetition of math facts was considered to be the goal of math instruction. In today's world, math instruction focuses on the understanding of concepts and then applying those concepts to solving real world problems." Wendy also pointed out that the students practice for the meets and that "the real learning occurs as students share their problem solving strategies and meaningful conversations take place."<BR>&nbsp;</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grosse Pointe Academy fourth and fifth graders participated in the fourth annual Science Fair this winter, the culmination of which was a parent evening on Wednesday, February 13 during which attendees had the opportunity to view all the display boards in the library while the young scientists were on hand to explain their methods and procedures.<BR><BR>Grade 4/5 teachers Vivek Nayak and Bob Lapadot led the project during science classes. They began by teaching the scientific method (stating the problem, formulating an hypothesis, listing the materials and procedures, recording observations, and forming a conclusion). Fourth graders worked in teams under the guidance of their teacher, conducting all of the work for their projects in class. The fifth graders worked independently, completing the majority of their work at home and meeting specific deadlines throughout the process.<BR><BR>Special certificates of recognition were awarded to the top three fifth grade projects. Congratulations go to winning scientists Bobby Kaiser, Kaley MacLeod and McCalla Mecke.<BR><BR>Bobby wondered whether a raw egg dropped from a two-story building would be protected from breaking better by peanut butter or jelly. His hypothesis that ?the peanut butter will protect the egg best, because it is thicker and a better insulator,? proved to be true.<BR><BR>Kaley?s project, ?Agein? Apples,? addressed whether Vitamin C has an effect on the rate at which an apple ages. Manufacturers of skin care products should pay attention to Kaley?s conclusion, which confirmed her hypothesis that Vitamin C does in fact affect the rate at which an apple ages.<BR><BR>Finally, McCalla posed the question whether a Matchbox race car goes faster at different heights of an incline. He too proved his hypothesis that the higher the incline, the faster the race car will go.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214135733.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214135748.jpg" border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080214135805.jpg" border=0><BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Grade 4/5 students went back in time to discover what a school day in the life of a child would be like in 1880, the year Rutherford B. Hayes was president.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080228095443.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>Students began the day with an opening ceremony of the pledge and a song. Then the children showed their best penmanship using slates on their laps, since students sat in benches without desks back then. They wrote a memory verse and then recited it with perfect elocution. Children assumed different names and ages, and some of them were siblings. Even the current events they discussed were from the 1880's. <BR><BR>Reading recitation was out of the McGuffey Readers. Fables were read to the children and the moral of the story was emphasized. The history lesson for the day was about the French and Indian War. Math included story problems and reciting the basic facts.<BR><BR>Excellent posture and good manners were required at all times. If these strict expectations were not followed, the consequences were either wearing a dunce cap or being reprimanded with a hictory stick. The students also participated in a spelling bee. Recess was&nbsp;a scavenger hunt throughout the Provencal-Weir house.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><EM>The following Letter to the Editor was sent to the Grosse Pointe News and the Detroit News on March 10, 2008.</EM></P><P>In response to Charles E. Ramirez's article of February 23, <EM>Private schools make public pitch,</EM> I would like to express our belief at The Grosse Pointe Academy that the economy is not what drives enrollment. While we don't dispute the state's Department of Education findings of private and public school enrollment declines in the last decade, I would like to point out that not all private schools have realized a drop in enrollment during the difficult economic times of late.&nbsp; At The Grosse Pointe Academy, an age 2 1/2 through grade 8 co-educational independent day school, we have realized an increase in enrollment of close to 5 percent over the last three years.<BR><BR>Credit for our stable and growing enrollment goes to our Board of Trustees, parent base and committed faculty and administrators who understand and communicate regularly with others in the community the value of an independent school education at The Grosse Pointe Academy.&nbsp; Families have become ?consumeristic? in attitudes about education, and it is increasingly critical to the success of a school to communicate the mission clearly.&nbsp; At the Academy, our mission has remained unchanged for more than a century and our marketing efforts help parents visualize our mission and strengths by consistent messaging using a four pillar strategy: a unique approach to education, a Christian way of life, an unparalleled campus and leadership and vitality.<BR><BR>We do find it increasingly important in this tough economy to communicate our scholarship and tuition assistance programs. Many parents who want the advantage of an Academy education for their children may not have considered it an option due to their lack of awareness of these programs. Last year 29% of our students received some sort of assistance and, of those, 27% of the families reported household incomes of $100,000 or more.<BR><BR>In the end, it is our experience that regardless of economic cycles, parents want the best possible education for their children. Those who recognize the benefits of an independent school education -- academic rigor, individualized attention, development of leadership skills, community service and civic participation, values education, and flat world diversity ? choose to invest in the future of their child.</P><P>Phil Demartini<BR>Head of School<BR>The Grosse Pointe Academy<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>When Jessica Ogden was in first grade at the Academy, her teacher, Barbara Karle, asked the students to draw what they wanted to be when they grew up. ?I drew a stick figure in a lab coat with a beaker,? Jessica said. That stick figure was a veterinarian.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080313112743.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>?I always knew I wanted to be a veterinarian,? Jessica explained, and she is well on her way to achieving that dream. After graduating from GPA in 2001, Jessica went on to attend Grosse Pointe South. During her high school career she served as a class senator for all four years, played volleyball (following three years of middle school volleyball), was a member of the National Honor Society, and graduated in the Academic Hall of Fame with a 4.2 grade point average. Now a junior at Michigan State University Honors College, Jessica received the ADS Scholarship, MSU?s most competitive merit-based scholarship, and was recently accepted to MSU?S College of Veterinary Medicine through a competitive early admission program.<BR><BR>Jessica attributes a lot of her success ?to the strong education foundation I received at GPA.? Her innate interest in science flourished at the Academy. ?I?m a zoologist now, and I will hear things in a college class and remember learning about that at the Academy. For example, in a microbiology class once the professor touched on the effect of lake toxins on microorganisms and I remembered learning about that in Mr. Fultz?s environmental science class.?<BR><BR>Making a model of carbon in seventh grade chemistry class with Michelle Roberts also came in handy. ?Six or seven years down the road there I was at MSU taking organic chemistry, which is carbon based, and learning a lot more about it than I ever imagined.?<BR><BR>Jessica benefitted from early instruction in other subjects as well. ?The French program was fabulous. I am forever indebted to Mrs. Vitolins because I pursued several 300 level French classes in college. I considered minoring in French, but don?t have room in my schedule because of all the science requirements.? While at South she achieved ?Laur?at National? designation from the Concours National de Fran?ais for excellence in the study of French. She also placed second in the state and ninth in the nation on the 2003 Level 2 National French exam.<BR><BR>Another favorite subject was social studies. Jessica recalls the study skills she learned from Mary Jo Johnson, in particular scrupulous note-taking. ?I love that woman!? she says. ?All of my teachers influenced me strongly in different ways, but Mrs. Johnson was probably my favorite!? <BR><BR>Jessica has a lot she still plans to accomplish before she starts at MSU?S College of Veterinary Medicine in the fall of 2009. Over the spring semester she will serve as a teaching assistant for a 300-level zoology course. This summer she will travel to Kenya, and next winter break she hopes to make it to the Antarctica. (Traveling is old hat to Jessica, who&nbsp; spent two weeks on a volunteer work project on Kangaroo Island in Australia.) Plans down the road after veterinary school include an internship and residence in surgery, orthopedics or oncology. She has a strong interest in marine mammals and wildlife rehabilitation. ?Ideally I would do that all my life,? she says. ?I would love to save the otters!? For the time being, however, she is ?keeping? her ?options open.?<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

Such was the "ancient secret about reading" that Johnathan Rand, author of&nbsp;the Michigan Chillers and The Adventure Club series,&nbsp;shared with Grosse Pointe Academy students during his visit to the school on April 8. During his hour-long presentation to first through sixth graders, Rand also shared personal anecdotes about how he went from working on the radio to writing books, infusing the children with his own love of reading and writing and encouraging them to do as much of both as possible.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080411155434.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>"You have this beautiful new library with all these wonderful books on the shelves," Rand told the children. "Isn't each of those books a place you can visit?"<BR><BR>Rand invoked some wonderful metaphors that spoke to the children's imaginations. "Books don't have covers; they have doors," he said. "You can go anywhere you want in the world from where you are." Holding up one of the simplest instruments invented - a pencil - he told them that "Your pencil is no longer a pencil; it becomes a magic wand. I call the process of writing 'creating magic.'"<BR><BR>He also had some practical advice to give to the future authors in the audience. "The most powerful secret I know is: if you want to be an author, don't be a writer; be a re-writer."<BR><BR>In reflecting on his visit, Rand referred to the Academy as "one of the most unique and beautiful schools we have ever visited.... Just walking in and around the building you can feel the history. It's like it's reaching out to you. The kids at The Grosse Pointe Academy have an incredible place to learn." Johnathan Rand talks about his visit in a video blog on his web site, <A href="http://www.americanchillers.com">www.americanchillers.com</A>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=black>The 4/5 students took an inside journey of "My Pyramid," visiting all seven bands. The first band was "Grains," where they learned about whole grains versus refined grain.&nbsp;After conducting a starch experiment on various&nbsp;foods, they&nbsp;were rewarded with the taste treat of a whole wheat bagel topped with nutritious apple-pear butter.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080425170221.jpg" align=null border=0><BR></P><P align=left>The second band they visited was "Vegetables and Fruits." The students<BR>learned the difference between a vegetable and a fruit.&nbsp;For example, they learned that&nbsp;a tomato is really a fruit because it has seeds. They tasted guacamole with fresh vegetables and sipped on 100% fruit and vegetable juices.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080425165951.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>Next they visited the&nbsp;"Milk" station. Here the students learned why calcium is so important for their bodies.&nbsp;They performed an&nbsp;experiment in which bones and eggs soaked in vinegar represented the acidic soda and caffeine drinks we put into our bodies that deplete our calcium levels. They tasted low fat natural yogurt topped with flax seed and string cheese.<BR><BR>Meat and beans was the fourth station visited. The students calculated how much protein their own body needs. They then read labels and chose five foods that would meet those requirements. The taste reward was pumpkin and sunflower seeds.<BR><BR>The "Fat and Oil" station was held in the cafeteria where the students learned about the good oils and fats to eat. They experimented by selecting various healthy foods from the cafeteria that meet the daily serving requirements. Here they sampled healthy fats and oils found in olives, along with whole wheat bread dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.<BR><BR>The students then worked out in the lower gym by skipping for fiveminutes. This was the "Physical Activity" band. The importance of hydration was demonstrated in a fruit experiment. They learned to take their pulse and related it to their own basil metabolic rate. They were very shocked by how high their heart rates increased with activity. Thereward here was well deserved H20.<BR><BR>Finally they played "Pyramid Bingo." Everyone sampled granola that consisted of foods from the five food groups. (The granola was made up of Cheerios, dried pineapple, M&amp;M's, sunflower seeds, wasabi peas, cranberries and currants.)<BR><BR>Says school nurse Patti Boynton, who organized the Nutrition Fair: "What really made the event such a success was the wonderful fourth and&nbsp;fifth grade parents who volunteered to man each station, teach the facts, and share their own everyday nutritional experiences with all of the students."</P>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[The 4/5 students took an inside journey of "My Pyramid," visiting all seven bands. The first band was "Grains," where they learned about whole grains versus refined grain. After conducting a starch experiment on various foods, they were rewarded with the taste treat of a whole wheat bagel topped with nutritious apple-pear butter.]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<title>The Eighth Grade Year: An Experience of a Lifetime</title>
		<link>http://www.gpacademy.org/news/the-eighth-grade-year-an-experience-of-a-lifetime/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>?Until you have graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy, you have no way of knowing what a unique experience the eighth grade year is,? says Scott Tily, Grades 4-8 Principal. ?The year is chock full of experiences that our students remember for the rest of their lives. In fact, many of them come back and talk about their memories of the eighth grade play, or performing for senior citizens as part of the Bell Choir.?</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080804110504.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=left>In the past, the fall of the eighth grade year kicked off with a trip to Camp Storer, but Scott adjusted the schedule several years ago so that students now go to Camp Storer in Napoleon, Michigan during the spring of their seventh grade year. <BR><BR>?The purpose of the Storer trip is for the class to bond as a unit,? says Scott, ?and we feel that the sooner this happens, the better.?<BR><BR>During the Storer trip in the spring, the students engage in trust-building exercises with one another and build confidence individually with such activities as the climbing wall and the high ropes, achieving success with the encouragement of their peers. Prior to the first day of school, classmates reunite after the long summer for a pizza party and the bonding experience continues.<BR><BR>Another favorite tradition is the first and eighth grade buddy program. Eighth grade advisor Marion Chrisner and first grade teachers Barbara Karle and Renee Martin spend a lot of time planning monthly activities so that the students get to know one another throughout the course of the year. The buddy program kicks off in September with the annual field trip to Miller?s Big Red Orchard &amp; Cider Mill, where the first and eighth graders pick apples together, pet farm animals, and go on a hay ride. ?The best part of the apple orchard trip or any of the buddy activities, as a matter of fact, is watching the eighth graders enjoy being little kids themselves,? says Marion Chrisner.<BR><BR>A trip to the Stratford Festival later in the fall is incorporated into the curriculum, as the students read and discuss the play (in the case of the 2007-08 school year, <EM>The Merchant of Venice</EM>) in class with language arts teacher Lawrence DeLuca before heading to Stratford, Ontario to see the play performed live. During the day, they enjoy lunch at a local restaurant and take in the sights. <BR><BR>Community service is another important part of the eighth grade year. In addition to the expectation to contribute to their communities independently, students are given the opportunity to perform service as a group, most notably when they perform at hospitals and for senior citizens as part of the Bell Choir.<BR><BR>In the spring, the students are treated to a trip to Cleveland that includes educational components, such as trips to museums and the symphony, and time for just plain fun, like hitting every roller coaster at Cedar Point. Shortly upon their return, it is time for final exams, which uniquely prepares them for the rigors of high school. Production of the eighth grade play begins at this point, and the day is broken up so that a morning exam is followed by a half day of play rehearsal. Once exams are complete, the students dedicate entire days to the play. This year, director Marion Chrisner chose ?Little Shop of Horrors? to fully showcase this group?s vocal, choreographic and dramatic talents.<BR><BR>Another class activity is preparing for the Baccalaureate service the morning of graduation under the guidance of Christian Life teacher Ellen Krease. The students select and read scripture, recite personal reflections, and perform musically, giving the service a personal flair unique to that class. That evening, of course, is graduation, followed by a reception on the Lakeshore lawn where a receiving line forms for faculty and parents to congratulate the students on achieving this milestone in their lives.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Academy Renovations Recognized for Outstanding Architecture and Design</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Last year at this time, The Grosse Pointe Academy was getting ready to open the doors of its renovated school building for students and faculty members to enjoy during the 2007-08 school year. This fall the school will open its doors once again, but this time to a building that has received a number of accolades and awards for outstanding architecture and design that focused on historic preservation as well as creating the best possible learning environment for students.<BR><BR>Most recently, the Academy was selected by <EM>School Planning &amp; Management</EM> magazine as a winner of the 2008 Impact on Learning Awards. Scores of entries were received showcasing schools from all across North America.<BR><BR>Says Jerry Enderle, Editor-in-Chief of <EM>School Planning &amp; Management</EM> magazine: ?This year?s winners represent a cross section of the best new construction and renovation projects in the U.S. The Grosse Pointe Academy project was among those recognized for solving real-world problems through innovative design, engineering, and technology solutions.?</P><P>All winning institutions will be honored at the 2008 Awards Banquet that will take place during the Council of Educational Facility Planners International?s (CEFPI) 85th Annual International Conference this fall in San Diego. The GPA project will also be published in the August 2008 issue of <EM>School Planning &amp; Management</EM> magazine and included in a special ?Impact on Learning? Award Supplement. Receiving recognition in the historic preservation category, the Academy?s renovations will appear on the magazine?s cover.<BR><BR>?The vision of The Grosse Pointe Academy was to bring a modern learning environment to its historic Moran building, and to do so without impacting the school?s striking Gothic exterior,? explained project architect Theo Pappas, AIA, of Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc. in Novi. ?A phased renovations program ?unlocked? the building by rearranging program areas and reclaiming space for education.?<BR><BR>Classrooms are now 200 to 250 square feet larger and can support modern educational programs for grades 1-8. New computers and plasma televisions in each classroom, and a new computer lab on the second floor, create a technology-rich environment. Teachers enjoy ample storage space, and new lighting systems reduce energy costs. Preservation efforts brought new life to the 78-year-old building by restoring windows and doors as well as the original Welsh tile in the main lobby.<BR><BR>The Grosse Pointe Academy was also recognized for outstanding architecture and design in education and appeared as a ?Project of Distinction? in the June 2008 issue of <EM>School Planning &amp; Management?s</EM> Education Design Showcase. Said Thomas P. McGinley, Special Projects Manager for the Education Design Showcase: ?Good designs don?t just happen. They are created due to the hard work of the district, the architect and the community. Each project may be unique, yet they all share one common goal: to provide the best possible learning environment for all students at all levels of education. The Grosse Pointe Academy?s project has achieved this goal.?<BR><BR>Finally, The Grosse Pointe Academy library was featured in the April 2008 issue of <EM>American Libraries</EM> magazine. The 2,800 square foot library renovation retained the original wood arches, historic pendant and sconce lighting, windows and wainscoting, while adding supplemental and task lighting and converting a former stage into a young children?s reading area.<BR><BR>Educational planning and interior design were led by Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., with Frank Rewold &amp; Sons serving as construction/project managers and Grissim Metz Andriese Associates leading the landscape architecture project. Lighting design was by Peter Basso Associates, Inc. and the historic preservation portion of the project was overseen by Gunn Levine Architects.</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>The Webster definition of volunteering is as follows: ?One who performs or gives services of his own free will. To give or offer of one?s own accord.? The following is Jennifer Bojarczyk and Abby Wujek?s definition of volunteering, which Jennifer shared during the year-end PCC breakfast in May.<BR><BR>?Volunteering means going through more shampoo and conditioner in one year because you have so much on your mind while in the shower you can?t remember if you washed your hair yet so you do it again. It means when your husband asks what?s for dinner, your answer is ?Hot dogs, but by the way, in order to get that hot dog, you have to grill for three hours in the rain, make over 300 hot dogs and serve them all.? It means when you decide to throw a surprise parade for Camille DeMario, you have to have the biggest float and therefore enlist the help of your father who is an engineer, your mother who is a decorator, and your sister who just feels sorry for you.<BR><BR>Abby and I were honored during the final Board meeting of the year for our two years of service, but the biggest honor we receive is knowing we have made a small difference in our children?s world. Every day we roam the halls, whether as PCC chairs, room moms, ambassadors or chairs of some other committee. We have witnessed the joy and pride our children take in our steps to make The Grosse Pointe Academy a better place for them. Both Henry and Nicholas are at an age to understand what their mommies do for their school. Volunteering is not easy, not always fun, doesn?t pay and can be frustrating. However, it is the best job that the two of us have ever had. We know that we have had an impact on our children?s futures by being a part of their education through our volunteer service. Both of us have donated a lot of our time and money over the past six years and we will continue to do so because we believe in this beautiful school, its leadership, its character and its mission. I can only hope that our efforts will encourage others to step forward. It is not how big the job is but the effort that is put into the job that makes it worth it. We do not need rewards or thanks from others. The smiles and praise we get from our children is the only reward we will ever need.?</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>For the second consecutive year, Grosse Pointe Academy&nbsp;seventh and eighth graders&nbsp;participated in the National French Contest Exam (also known as <EM>Le Grand Concours</EM>) with outstanding results. This 60-minute national examination is developed and managed by the American Association of Teachers of French. Its purpose is to help stimulate further interest in the teaching and learning of French as well as to help identify and reward student achievement.<BR><BR>The exam is a multiple-choice test of approximately 70 items covering listening comprehension, vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Students took the test that was appropriate for the French curriculum in which they are enrolled. Their scores were then ranked against students locally as well as nationally who are enrolled in similar curricula.<BR><BR>Competing against both middle school and high school students, the following Academy middle schoolers placed in the top ten nationally:&nbsp; eighth graders Samantha Fitzpatrick (95th percentile with a #2 chapter ranking and #4 national ranking), Grace Rentschler (95th percentile with a #3 chapter ranking and #5 national ranking), Somers Brush (95th percentile with a #4 chapter ranking and #6 national ranking), Henry Brophy (90th percentile with a #8 chapter ranking and #10 national ranking), Robert Stanley (90th percentile with a #8 chapter ranking and #10 national ranking), and seventh grader Katherine Woodward (90th percentile with a #3 chapter ranking and #6 national ranking).<BR><BR>The sixth graders took the FLES exam, which includes a speaking section as well. Students are only ranked nationally for this exam. Kate Krueger ranked #9 nationally, and Caleb Cimmarrusti ranked #10 nationally.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080523152623.jpg" align=null border=0><BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT color=#000000>It may have rained during the surprise parade for Camille DeMario on Monday, but the rain didn't dampen spirits, nor did it spoil the surprise. Miss Camille showed up for what she thought was a pep rally prior to GPA's annual Spring Spirit Night, only to find out that it was in fact a tribute to her 39 years at the Academy. Early School classes and lower and middle school grades created a variety of floats in her honor, then paraded around the Tracy Fieldhouse. The students selected themes for their floats that they felt best represented their memories of their Early and Lower School Principal, from "We Can Always Count on You" (Miss Kate's three-day class), to "You are My Sunshine" (grade 1) and "Golfing into the Future" (grade 5).<BR><BR>Special thanks go to PCC co-chairs Jennifer Bojarczyk and Abby Wujek and room parents for planning and organizing the event, as well as all the parents who assisted with float building and hosting float building parties.</FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102129.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102319.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102344.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102410.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102434.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102458.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080516102541.jpg" align=null border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>For the third consecutive year, middle school students Somers Brush and Alex Parker battled it out against one another in the final round of the annual Grosse Pointe Academy spelling bee. Somers was declared champion in 2005-06, with Alex winning his revenge as champion in 2006-07. Now eighth graders, they met for their final match-up, and, in spite of the violent nature of the two final words ? ?lacerate? and ?hemorrhage? ? the mood was congenial and good sportsmanship prevailed when Somers was ultimately declared champion for 2007-08.&nbsp; </FONT></P><P align=center><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080523152504.jpg" align=null border=0></FONT></P><P align=left><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>Fourth grader Jack Sheeren, a new student at the Academy this year, made it to the final three in his debut performance. ?This was actually the first year that fourth graders competed,? said 4/5 teacher Bob Lapadot, who has moderated the Academy?s spelling bee for 21 years. ?I was impressed with all of the students, but particularly the younger ones. It is not easy to get up in front of your peers and older students like that. It is a great opportunity for these kids to learn how to be poised and think on their feet in front of an audience.?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Verdana color=#333333>Congratulations go to all the top spellers in their grades who qualified for the bee based on two rounds of written tests.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>A typical day at The Grosse Pointe Academy generally does not involve knighthood ceremonies, three-course meals or judgments, but then again Friday, May 16 was not a typical day at GPA. While the 4/5 students rested from their trip to Washington, D.C., the seventh graders tested their physical skills at Camp Storer, and the eighth graders took in the sights on their Cleveland trip, the sixth graders ruled the land with the annual sixth grade medieval feast.<BR><BR>Organized by social studies teachers Harriett Whitaker and Mary Jo Johnson, the event has become a popular tradition among the students. Parents, or "serving wenches," served a first course of bread, soup and pears, a second course of chicken, roast potatoes and baby carrots, and a final course of dessert. In between courses, King Scott (Tily) and Queen Harriett (Whitaker) and an assortment of guests that included a priest, lords and ladies of the manor, knights and squires, all seated according to their status, enjoyed a knighting ceremony, entertainment by musicians, dancers, jugglers, poets, jesters, and several judgments during which folks in the gallery decided whether an evildoer should be set free or sent to the dungeon. A special thanks goes to Huong Riley who did a phenomenal job organizing the parents and assisting Mrs. Whitaker with making additional costumes.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080530143642.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080530143705.jpg" align=null border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P align=left><FONT color=#000000>During the last week of school, while the rest of the students were busy finishing up classes, going on picnics, and enjoying end-of-year celebrations, the eighth grade was going full throttle in the production of an Academy tradition: the eighth grade play. This year the students put on "Little Shop of Horrors" under the direction of music teacher Marion Chrisner.<BR><BR>"As I think about the eighth grade play, I look carefully at the personalities of the class: what kind of humor do they have; what is their work ethic; how creative is their group imagination; how well are they able to support one another; and how much are they willing to share of themselves," says Mrs. Chrisner.<BR><BR>The next element is to cast the show in a manner that gives each eighth grader a part that showcases his or her unique personality, to make the parts as equal as possible, and then to provide a chance for each student to contribute to the overall production. For this year's play, this resulted in six trios, fourteen Audreys, eight Seymours, three dentists and three reporters.<BR><BR>The final criterion for the show itself is to divide the creative portion of the show so that each student takes responsibility for a particular area such as sound, lighting, costumes, construction, and "all the small details that bring success." According to Marion, "Ownership in the final product is a matter of pride and an outstanding lesson in learning."<BR><BR>The results, from the standpoint of those who attended the final performance on June 10, were spectacular.</FONT><FONT color=#000000></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080613140623.jpg" align=null border=0></FONT></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080613140645.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080613140700.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080613140722.jpg" align=null border=0></P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20080613140736.jpg" align=null border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

As said by one of her references, ?Your school is so lucky to be able to hire such a tremendous person and committed educator. We already feel the void at our school.?</P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Providing a safe and protected environment for students will always be a top objective for educators.&nbsp;Recently, the administration of The Grosse Pointe Academy took its commitment to creating an ideal learning environment to a microscopic level by treating the entire facility with the TriBan Antimicrobial System from Triton Technology Group, LLC.<BR><BR>The dreaded words of ?mold, mildew and bacteria? are rarely good news for any commercial property owner, especially a school administrator.&nbsp; At a minimum, microbial contamination can cause stains, odors and property damage to facilities and at the extreme facilities have been condemned for poor air quality, ?sick building syndrome? and even found to harbor super-bugs like the antibiotic resistant MRSA bacteria.<BR><BR>?By their very nature, schools are an environment where germs can easily get passed around.&nbsp; For us, children and faculty missing school days is a major concern in our efforts,? said Phil Demartini, head of school at GPA.&nbsp; ?We believe it is our responsibility to do everything in our power to proactively make this learning environment as safe as possible.&nbsp; Treating all of the Academy?s surfaces with the powerful TriBan Antimicrobial System gives us the confidence of knowing that we have done just that.?<BR><BR>According to the Indoor Air Quality and Student Performance study by the EPA, ?Evidence continues to emerge showing that poor indoor air quality (IAQ) can cause illness requiring absence from school, and can cause acute health symptoms that decrease performance while at school.&nbsp; In addition, recent data suggest that poor IAQ may directly reduce a person?s ability to perform specific mental tasks requiring concentration, calculation, or memory.?&nbsp; (Revised August 2003, 402-K-03-006)<BR><BR>?Microbes such as pathogenic bacteria like MRSA, and air quality issues caused by mold and mildew, are not what school administrators should be worried about,? said Art McWood, president of the Triton Technology Group.&nbsp; ?They should be able to focus on the challenge of educating our kids in the best environment possible.&nbsp; That confidence only comes with the continually active, comprehensive TriBan Antimicrobial System.?<BR><BR>?The key to the TriBan system is our durable antimicrobial application,? McWood continued. This EPA registered antimicrobial forms an extremely durable bond on a surface, killing all the microbes present on contact and essentially creating a molecular ?bed of nails? all over the treated area.&nbsp; It makes the surface physically inhospitable to future microbial growth. To the human eye and touch, the application is invisible, but for microbes, it is an end-game.?<BR><BR>The Grosse Pointe Academy was treated from top to bottom with the TriBan Antimicrobial System, covering all the major surfaces of the building including the cafeteria, lockers, hallways, classrooms, athletic facilities.<BR><BR>Unlike most other antimicrobials that leach chemicals or heavy metals into the air and the surrounding environment, the unique technology controls microbial growth without leaching, making it an effective, ?green? alternative for schools.<BR><BR>?Part of our decision to choose the TriBan System was a concern for the environment. I didn?t want my preventative measures to only add more chemicals and toxins into the very environment I am trying to protect. Knowing that this was a non-invasive, green technology really made choosing TriBan easy,? said Demartini.<BR><BR>The TriBan Antimicrobial System is a comprehensive approach to microbial treatment and prevention.&nbsp; It begins with extensive testing of the facility to determine what contaminants are present and what problem areas exist.&nbsp; Then a customized treatment plan is created for a school that involves a deep cleaning with an EPA registered germ killer and fungicide and followed by an application of Triton?s continuously active antimicrobial to the surfaces.&nbsp; Finally, post-testing by an independent lab and a long-term service plan covers annual re-inspections, retesting and service calls complete the process.<BR><BR>Located in downtown Detroit, Triton Technology Group is the exclusive provider of the TriBan Antimicrobial System.&nbsp; Triton offers an extensive line-up of antimicrobial treatments and applications servicing a broad range of industries including schools, athletic facilities, marinas, new construction and health care facilities.&nbsp; For more information about Triton Technology Group and the TriBan System, please call (313) 963-7979 or visit <A href="http://www.tritontg.com">www.tritontg.com</A>.<BR></P>]]></content:encoded>

Each student, from Early School through Grade 8, is encouraged to bring in pennies to contribute to the penny jars available in each classroom. A friendly competition among classes will be held, and Ryan Marier, Assistant Vice President and personal banker at Chase Bank in Grosse Pointe, has volunteered to count the pennies free of charge and to keep individual class accounts. Stay tuned for reports of the students' progress!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">Dr. David Walsh, one of the world&rsquo;s leading authorities on parenting and the impact of media on children&rsquo;s health and development, addressed parents and educators on October 28 at The Grosse Pointe Academy. The topic was &ldquo;No: Why Kids of All Ages Need to Hear It and Ways Parents Can Say It.&rdquo; Dr. Walsh was this year&rsquo;s featured speaker in the Academy&rsquo;s annual McMillan Lecture Series, which is a gift from Thayer and Gioconda McMillan given in memory of William Charles McMillan III in the interest of emphasizing the importance of elementary education.<br /><br />The main theme of Dr. Walsh&rsquo;s talk was self-discipline. According to Walsh, self discipline is a key character trait that leads to success in school and in life.&nbsp;Self-discipline helps kids stay on task, finish a task, stay focused, be engaged, take on a challenge, make better decisions and resist what Walsh called &ldquo;the siren call of entitlement: &lsquo;Gotta have it and gotta have it now!&rsquo;&rdquo; Parents who say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and use the parenting skills of No are re-discovering parenting strategies that work, said Walsh.<br /><br />As an example, Dr. Walsh told what he referred to as the &ldquo;Marshmallow Story.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Almost forty years ago, a group of scientists performed a very important experiment with children,&rdquo; Dr. Walsh told the audience. &ldquo;Parents brought three-and-four-year old boys and girls into a room one by one, where the scientist presented them with a choice. They could either eat a marshmallow that he gave them right away, or they could wait until he came back with a second marshmallow. Some of those little boys and girls gobbled up that marshmallow before the door was even closed; others did whatever they could to wait for that second marshmallow. The important thing about the experiment is that the scientists followed those children all the way through their growing-up years &ndash; through elementary school, the teenage years, into early adulthood. The conclusion of the experiment was that the ability to wait for that second marshmallow was an amazingly strong predictor of those children&rsquo;s success and happiness through school and into early adulthood. That experiment was really a measure of a critical success factor: self-discipline.&rdquo;<br /><br />Dr. Walsh is the author of nine books, including the national best seller <em>Why Do They Act That Way? A Survival Guide to the Adolescent Brain for You and Your Teen.</em> His latest book, <em>No: Why Kids &ndash; of All Ages &ndash; Need to Hear It and Ways Parents Can Say It</em>, serves as the focal point of the <em>Say Yes to No</em> campaign, which teaches parents and educators how to instill self-discipline in America&rsquo;s children.</p><p align="left">Dr. Walsh has authored columns on numerous topics, including Internet addition and the dangers of MySpace.com. A frequent guest on national radio and television, he has appeared on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Today Show, Good Morning America, The CBS Early Show, The News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Dateline NBC, ABC&rsquo;s 20/20</em>, and National Public Radio&rsquo;s <em>All Things Considered</em> and <em>Morning</em> <em>Edition</em>. He has received numerous awards, including the Council on Family Relation&rsquo;s Friend of the Family Award.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">Thanks to the generosity of the Sherer family, children in the Early School may now enjoy a lovely fall harvest garden outside the building by the playground. In addition to planting the garden, Mr. and Mrs. Sherer, parents of Gerry in the three-day classroom, donated a giant pumpkin to serve as the garden's centerpiece. The pumpkin is so large, one almost expects to see a tiny Cinderella surrounded by tiny mice doormen! Gerry is pictured below with his classmates in Miss Kate's 3-day room.</p><p align="center"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081024112923.jpg" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P align=left>Mrs. Stepanek and Mrs. Wolney's third graders are studying&nbsp;The Grosse Pointe Academy's&nbsp;local history and heritage. The children will put together a class book based on the school's history. The book will include each child's own photographs of his or her favorite spot at school, along with a write-up on its historical significance. This Friday afternoon the students, accompanied by their teachers and Early and Lower School Principal Jennifer Kendall, took a walking tour of the neighborhood. Along the way they heard stories of the development of the land, from the first settlers in this area to recent history of certain landmarks. The tour ended with a special activity at St. Paul's Cemetery.</P><P align=center><IMG src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081024140819.jpg" align=null border=0></P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<P>Everyone, from young children to adults, should take time out of their busy schedules to stretch, breathe, and relax their minds and bodies, according to P.E. teacher Cheryl Carroll. As a teacher who focuses on the physical health and wellness of her students, Cheryl is a big believer that physical activity helps children relieve stress, focus in class, and perform better overall. A natural outgrowth of this philosophy is incorporating yoga into the classroom. Cheryl has invited Heidi George, a certified yoga teacher from Yoga Ed., to train Academy teachers in using simple yoga-based mind-body integration strategies for effective stress and behavior and classroom management. Heidi teaches students, teachers and parents in the Grosse Pointe community. Yoga Ed. is geared for pre-school through middle school.<BR><BR>After a preliminary session with faculty members, Heidi will hold weekly after-school sessions for teachers beginning in November. A pilot afterschool program for students will follow in December.<BR><BR>First graders in Barbara Karle?s class enjoyed a visit from Heidi earlier this fall. Heidi led the children in stretching exercises and taught them a variety of relaxation techniques. </P>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy renovations to the main school building continue to receive accolades and awards locally, nationally and internationally. Most recently, the Academy received a 2009 Citation of Excellence Award from <em>Learning By Design</em>, a school and university leader's annual guide to architectural services published by Stratton Publishing &amp; Marketing Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia.<br /><br />From among a multitude of projects submitted throughout the country, the Academy's design project was deemed one of the best by a nationally recognized panel of architects and educational facility specialists. As a Citation of Excellence Award winner, the project will receive special editorial feature coverage and a free listing in the print and electronic Facilities Resources Buyer's Guide. The project and the Academy will also be showcased online at <a href="http://www.learningbydesign.biz">www.learningbydesign.biz</a>.<br /><br />&quot;The Academy's selection as a Citation of Excellence Award winner from among this competitive field of entries is a genuine tribute to the school and the project,&quot; said project architect Theo Pappas, AIA, of Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc. in Novi. &quot;I am particularly proud of this award, because the judge and jury were not just architects or designers, but educators and educational planners. This is a continuing testimony to all the hard work and effort of everyone who was so dedicated to making this happen.&quot;<br /><br />The school will receive a commemorative plaque in recognition of this achievement. Head of School Phil Demartini has invited Theo Pappas to personally present this plaque at the Board of Trustees meeting in January.<br /><br />The Academy also won a Preservation Wayne, Preservation Honor &quot;Regional Neighbor&quot; Award for the restoration of the main school building. Preservation Wayne is Detroit&rsquo;s oldest and largest preservation organization dedicated to preserving, promoting, and protecting the neighborhoods and structures that define Detroit. The Academy will be recognized at the &quot;Past, Forward&quot; 2008 Preservation Honor Awards Dinner at the Colony Club Detroit on November 20. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First grade and eighth grade students enjoyed some special visits from parents, who shared insights from their respective professions to enrich their studies.<br /><br />Geoff Donaldson, an environmental planner and father of Bridget (grade 4) and Timothy (grade 1), visited Mrs. Martin's first grade class as part of their occupation unit to discuss how he helps to make the environment safe for everyone. Using a model and a spray bottle, he demonstrated to the children how rain washes pollutants into the sewers, which eventually carries pollutants to the waterways, and how building smaller, more curved waterways helps slow down the movement of water so that fewer pollutants get into larger waterways.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081114152150.jpg" /></center><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><span class="copy"><div align="left">John Engstrom, a federal prosecutor and parent of Sophie (grade 5) and Miles (grade 2), spoke to eighth graders about the Constitution as part of their study of American government in social studies class with Mary Jo Johnson.</div></span></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Science class was a blast for Academy fourth and fifth graders this week &ndash; literally! During what 4/5 teacher Bob Lapadot historically calls &quot;V-Day,&quot; students withstood the cold outside to set off over 60 volcanoes. The volcanoes were made at home with the help of on-line tips, the creativity of the students and their parents, and some good old-fashioned baking soda and vinegar. Another popular ingredient choice was the particularly explosive combination of mentos and Diet Coke.</p><p>One of the strengths of this popular project, which the students do during either their fourth or fifth grade year, was the amount of flexibility given to each young scientist, allowing for endless creativity. &ldquo;Our philosophy is that the children don&rsquo;t need kits,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;They have vivid imaginations. Why not let them run with it? And the results were spectacular &ndash; volcanoes of every size, color and shape imaginable.&quot;</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081121173745.jpg" /></center><center></center><center><em>Students were not shy about volunteering to set off their volcanoes!</em></center><center></center><center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081121173815.jpg" /></center><center></center><center><em>James Raudabaugh's volcano successfully erupted before admiring bystanders.</em></center><center><em></em></center><center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20081121173912.jpg" /></center><center></center></center></center><center><em>Creativity was an important component of the volcano project.</em></center>]]></content:encoded>

That everyone can get a good education.&quot; They dream &quot;to help kids go to better schools&quot; and &quot;to help the environment and the economy.&quot;<br /><br />The students, with the help of their buddies, expressed their dreams in words and pictures after the special grade 1-8 assembly held on Friday afternoon in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. The assembly, which was held in the Chapel, featured brief remarks from Phil Demartini, Wendy Demartini and Rosi Triano, the telling by eighth graders of the story of Marian Anderson, the first African American woman to sing with the Metropolitan Opera, the singing of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; by faculty members, and a solo vocal performance by eighth grader Giovanna Posselius.<br /><br />Following the assembly, the students gathered in the classrooms with their buddies to write and illustrate their dreams for America. These letters will be mailed to President Barack Obama on Presidential Inauguration Day on January 20.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090116151344.jpg" /></center><center></center><center></center><center></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090116151355.jpg" /></center><center></center><center></center><center></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090116151410.jpg" /></center><center></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pennies for Peace fundraising drive concluded during a Chapel assembly on February 2, and the final results are in! The total amount raised was $2,417.57. Equally impressive is the weight (1335 pounds) and volume (46 gallons) of the pennies donated. The top five classes (in total dollars raised) are: Janice Sturm, Kate Banfield, Mary Jo Carrier, Wendy Demartini and Marsha Thomas.<br /><br />The top five classes per capita are: Debby Wolney, Kate Banfield, Janice Sturm, Marsha Thomas, and Wendy Demartini. In both cases, Devin Mequio's second grade class and the sixth grade were close behind.<br /><br />The Student Council raised $68.34 that was divided among the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Dylan and Derek Demkowiz and Karstan and Nikolas Minanov earned tips at the Action Auction Legends Party that they donated to the program. This amount was divided among their respective class accounts. Other donations included a glass jug filled with pennies from past parent Chuck Begg&nbsp;totalling $263.02. This amount was divided among the classes.<br /><br />&quot;I want to thank all the teachers for supporting this cause and creating enthusiasm for it among their students,&quot; said Alexia Minanov, who spearheaded the effort. Denise Phelps, who served as faculty coordinator, gave special mention to second grader Danny Arkison. &quot;Danny was a great help to me in keeping count of the penny jars and putting on stickers as the jars were submitted,&quot; Denise said. &quot;I really appreciated his sincere and eager assistance.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition to showcasing the new Valade Art Loft &amp; Gallery and student artwork from&nbsp;kindergarten to grade 8,&nbsp;The Grosse Pointe Academy Art Show featured the works of local artist and former GPA art teacher Jane McFeely. Making its debut was an original oil painting of the Early School statue that Jane created especially for Action Auction 2009. This stunning work of art is featured on the cover of the Action Auction catalog and will be a highlight of the live auction on Saturday, May 9.<br /><br />The Art Show was well attended and well received. Many visitors commented that it was their first time on the third floor art loft. &quot;I love seeing it full of student art like this,&quot; said Head of School Phil Demartini. &quot;This is truly how the architects envisioned it when they designed this space.&quot;<br /></p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090409141340.jpg" /><br /><br /><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090409141405.jpg" /><br /><br /></center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090409141422.jpg" /><br /><br /><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090409141443.jpg" /></center></center></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The annual Back to School Picnic created quite a splash with the Academy community this year! In spite of a gloomy forecast, the clouds parted and the sun shone for the event. Fear of rain drove part of the event indoors into the Tracy Fieldhouse, with the Spiderman obstacle course, Midway games and Dunk Tank positioned around the Early School circle. This new venue proved popular with many of the attendees, who enjoyed the D.J., music and table seating indoors while there was ample space to enjoy games and activities outdoors.</p><p><img border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090910152136.jpg" />A popular addition with the students this year was the Dunk Tank. Faculty members Michelle Roberts, Cheryl Carroll, Harriett Whitaker, Sasha Murphy, and Lawrence DeLuca, along with Middle School Principal Scott Tily (pictured at left), took turns on the hot seat. Several students were two for two in dunking their favorite teachers!</p><p>Also popular with the younger children were the Midway games. Special thanks go to all Back to School Picnic committee members Kate Patterson, Alison Arkison and Katie Drettmann, and to all of the PCC volunteers who helped with the picnic, from decorations to manning the booths for the games. </p><p>The Back to School Picnic marked the beginning of the Academy's 40th anniversary celebration, with more events to come!</p><p align="center"><img border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090910160947.jpg" /></p><p align="left">Dougie dunks dad!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to this year's Continental Math League (CML) winners! The top scorers in each grade were recognized during a grade 1-8 Chapel assembly on Monday, April 6. The winners are (from left) second grader Margaux Schaller, third grader Elizabeth Sheeren, fourth grader David Scupholm, fifth graders Jack Sheeren and Alexander Minanov, sixth grader Jonathan Valente, seventh grader Joe DiMauro, and eighth grader Jeffrey Woolstrum.</p><p align="center"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090406141352.jpg" /></p><div align="left"><span class="copy">Jack Sheeren and Alexander Minanov both had perfect scores and their names will join eighth grader Dylan Demkowicz's on a special plaque that recognizes all GPA students who received perfect scores. David Scupholm recorded his second consecutive win, while Jeffrey Woolstrum has been the top scoring student for his grade for the last three years.<br /><br />The Continental Math League is a nationally sponsored mathematical competition. Students are challenged to solve six difficult problems in thirty minutes. Each correct answer is worth one point. The problems are designed to encourage students to use a variety of problem solving techniques in the areas of mathematical and visual problem solving. This was the fourth year at the Academy that students in grades 2-8 participated in the Continental Math League competition. Grades 2 and 3 have three meets while grades 4-8 have five meets. The top six scores at each grade are sent in to the CML headquarters in New Jersey. <br /></span><span class="copy"><br />&ldquo;The world of math is changing,&rdquo; said grade 4/5 teacher Wendy Demartini, who, as Curriculum Coordinator, brought the CML competition to the Academy several years ago. &ldquo;It used to be that rote repetition of math facts was considered to be the goal of math instruction. In today&rsquo;s world, math instruction focuses on understanding concepts and then applying those concepts to solving real world problems.&rdquo; </span></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week several Academy students were featured in the Streetwise Section of the <em>Grosse Pointe News,</em> where they were asked who they would most like to meet. Third grader Joseph Spica responded that he would most like to meet Winston Churchill. (Churchill was also the famous person in history whom Joseph chose for his third grade social studies research project.)<br /><br />A gentleman named Jim Rauh, who is a member of the Winston Churchill Society, read Joseph's remark. Mr. Rauh then contacted the <em>Grosse Pointe News</em>, who contacted GPA, who then contacted Joseph's teacher, Mrs. Wolney, to arrange a special visit.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090406143409.jpg" /></center><p>As a result, all of the children enjoyed a visit from Mr. Rauh, who regaled them with many stories about Winston Churchill. He also presented Joseph with an autographed book entitled <em>Churchill</em> that was written and signed by Churchill's granddaughter, Celia Sandys.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="copy">Academy&nbsp;parents are very generous with their time and expertise, sharing their knowledge of a range of subjects, from discussing their occupations to opening the&nbsp;children's&nbsp;eyes to different cultures and traditions. Mary Alice Mecke, mother of kindergartner Courtney and sixth grader McCalla, has paid regular visits to Mrs. Varty's classroom over the years&nbsp;to share her knowledge of the Japanese culture. Last week, Cherine Smith, mother of kindergartener Zakariya, visited Mrs. Carrier's classroom to teach the children about Egypt. She even brought a teddy bear and gauze for each child to learn the art of wrapping a mummy! Representing another continent entirely, Mary Beth Nicholson, mother of four-year-old Margaret, and Jason MacQueen, father of&nbsp;three-year-old Caitlin, came to the Early School for their demonstration on Scotland fully dressed in kilts with bagpipes in hand.</span></p><span class="copy"><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090406150057.jpg" /></center><center></center><center></center><center></center><center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090406155532.jpg" /></center></center></span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>True to a line in the play, the second and third grade musical production of &quot;Rats&quot; was truly more entertaining for parents in the audience than any Broadway production. A cast of townsfolk including a baker, a banker, a mayor, town council people, children, rats and a pied piper told the story of how one must remain true to one's promises or pay the price (hence the expression, &quot;pay the pied piper&quot;). The production was under the direction of Early and Lower School music teacher Roshell Chuhran. Special thanks go to Claudia Leslie for helping Roshell paint the landscape of the town of Hamlin, and to art teacher Bryan Zink for his creative touch with the village houses.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090424143205.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090424143228.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090424143243.jpg" /><br /><br /><br /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090424143301.jpg" /></center></center></center></center><p><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, April 25, Academy seventh and eighth graders headed to Madonna University in Livonia to participate in the first Michigan China Quiz Bowl. As GPA is one of the only middle schools in the area to offer Chinese, our students competed with second and third year high school students from Cranbrook, the University of Detroit Jesuit and Troy High School. The quiz bowl consisted of three regulation rounds and a championship round.<br /><br /></p><div align="left"><span class="copy"><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090501143655.jpg" /></center><div align="left"><br /><br />&ldquo;Our students did a wonderful job under great pressure,&rdquo; reported Chinese teacher Lucia Crane. In fact, one of the eighth grade teams advanced to the finals, where they lost to Troy, which has offered Chinese for eleven years, in a tie-breaker. GPA came home with a second place trophy in Division IA, and a second place trophy in Division II.</div></span></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hear ye! Hear ye! While the fourth and fifth graders traveled to Mackinac Island for their Michigan trip, and the seventh graders headed to Storer Camps for some class bonding and the eighth grade to Cleveland for their end-of-the-year hurrah, let us hereby declare the sixth graders rulers of the school for their study of the Middle Ages! This social studies unit officially culminated, by order of the king, with the annual sixth grade medieval feast on Friday morning.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090515144341.jpg" /></center><p>The event began with the grand entrance of the king, accompanied by squires and a priest. Queried the king: &ldquo;Priest Omar! Have these squires spent the night in chapel praying for their souls?&rdquo;</p><p>The priest responded: &ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty.&rdquo; The king then turned to the squires. &ldquo;Have you, Squires, prayed to God asking for protection of your soul and to follow the Code of Chivalry</p><p>&rdquo;Yes we have,&rdquo; responded the squires.</p><p>&quot;Do you promise to be brave in battle, honorable to your Lord and Liege, redress any wrong, protect women and children, help those in trouble, show mercy to the weak and defenseless, so help you God?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes we do!&rdquo; trumpeted the squires.</p><p>During the feast, students were divided into manor groups with a lord or lady as the head of the manor. They competed for farthings, and the manor with the most farthings was granted the head table. Those who sat below the salt were seated according to their rank.</p><p>King William (Middle School principal Scott Tily) greeted the guests as they entered the &ldquo;manor on the lake&rdquo; &ndash; the Academy&rsquo;s Lakeshore building &ndash; then conducted a knighting ceremony. The students played the roles of knights, monks, priests, lords and ladies of the land, and pages. They also provided entertainment as jugglers, jesters,&nbsp;dancers, magicians and musicians. There was even a duel!&nbsp;Several &ldquo;serving wenches&rdquo; (i.e., mothers of the sixth graders dressed in costume) prepared and served the food. The meal was presented in three courses: &ldquo;first serve&rdquo; was a bread bowl of soup; &ldquo;second serve&rdquo; consisted of chicken legs, saffron rice, carrots, and mead (apple cider); and &ldquo;third serve&rdquo; (dessert)&nbsp;was ginger cookies and pears. After each course was announced, two food tasters sampled the food to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t poisoned. Judgments were announced for evil deeds, with the priest begging for mercy for the evildoer. The folks in the gallery decided whether that person should be freed or sent to the dungeon.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090515144419.jpg" /></center><p>Contributing to the ambiance of the banquet were family crests and banners that the students created. Throughout the afternoon, students from other grade levels stopped in to observe the festivities.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090515144435.jpg" /></center><p>Thursday of Medieval Week was &quot;Monk Day.&quot; The students experienced the monastic life of the middle ages as they meditated in the Chapel, ate only bread and water, and slept in cells with only a single sheet of newspaper for a blanket. Any monks who broke the code of silence had to wear a hair shirt in penance.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090515144449.jpg" /></center><p>The students were given a respite from their study of the Middle Ages on Thursday afternoon when they enjoyed a Poetry Cafe. While each student read from his or her poetry journal (a selection of free verse, limericks, haiku, acrostics and many others), classmates lounged on pillows and ate snacks while snapping their fingers to demonstrate their approval of their peers' work.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090515144503.jpg" /></center><p>Special thanks go to Harriett Whitaker and Mary Jo Johnson for all their work in coordinating these events and to all the parent volunteers, in particular Mary Alice Mecke,&nbsp;who helped with costume fittings and who provided snacks and drinks for the Poetry Cafe and prepared and served food for the banquet.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Memorial Day, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Homsy visited his son Matt's sixth grade social studies class to talk about what it means to be in the Army.<br /><br />Tying in what the students had studied about the American government, he was able to convey to the students a sense of what it means to be in the Army and to share some glimpses of his 22 years of experiences all over the world, most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. With his prompting, the students came up with the following reasons why a nation needs a military: to keep us safe, to make a point, to stand up for what we believe in, to protect other countries, and to make the world a better place.<br /><br />Lieutenant Colonel Homsy plans to return in early June to talk with his daughter Hannah's fifth grade class. His son, Ian, is a third grader in Mrs. Stepanek's class.<span class="copy"><font face="Verdana" color="#333333"><span class="copy"><font face="Verdana" color="#333333"><span class="copy"><font face="Verdana" color="#333333"><font face="Verdana" color="#333333"><span class="copy"></span></font></font></span></font></span></font></span></p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090522172348.jpg" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a sunny but not too hot day for&nbsp;the Academy's annual Field Day on Friday, May 29. Students in grades 1-5 competed in the traditional relay races, tug-o-war, and flag tag competitions, not to mention a hockey shootout, golf chipping and putting, a fireman's relay, and a muscle man contest, among many other games and challenges. Seventh graders helped organize the games for the younger children, and the kindergarteners had their own field day on the Moran lawn. Sixth graders were put to the test by their homeroom teachers with a variety of games that required skills of cooperation, such as untying a human knot.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090601095830.jpg" /></center><center><span class="copybold">The Nun's Walk provides a perfect setting for the putting contest.</span></center><center><br /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20090601095917.jpg" /></center></center><center><span class="copybold"><center>She shoots!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" align="left" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091002162701.jpg" />Academy students in grades 1-8 enjoyed a special surprise on Friday, October 2 courtesy of Academy alumni. At 1:15 p.m., Head of School Phil Demartini rang a bell up and down the hallways to announce a surprise known as a <em>Cong&eacute;</em> - a tradition dating back to the Academy of the Sacred Heart days when the ringing of the bell signaled a surprise dismissal from classes. Many students may recall the <em>Cong&eacute;</em> from four years ago when the school last celebrated its Alumni History Day, but for others it was brand new.</p><p>The students, faculty and staff congregated in the Tracy Fieldhouse for a special presentation of a &quot;Then and Now&quot; PowerPoint and comments from Mrs. Walter B. Robinson, ASH alumna, past parent and GPA founding trustee, who helped kick off the event along with fellow founding trustee Mrs. Carole Peabody, ASH '51 and Sr. Gail O'Donnell,&nbsp;ASH alumna and former ASH headmistress who was one of the nuns instrumental in the transition between ASH and The Grosse Pointe Academy. These special guests, who each played an instrumental role in keeping the school alive forty years ago,&nbsp;shared brief remarks with the students about their own memories of a <em>Cong&eacute;</em>. Also present were Roselie Posselius '73, President of the GPA Alumni Association and past parent (Giovanna Posselius '09), and Mary Alice Mecke '74, current parent (Courtney Mecke, grade 1 and McCalla Mecke, grade 7) and chair of GPA's 40th Anniversary Celebration. Both Roselie and Mary Alice were students forty years ago when the school re-opened as The Grosse Pointe Academy.</p><p>The presentation in the Tracy Fieldhouse concluded with the singing of a traditional song, <em>Donne, Donne-Nous un Beau Jour</em> (&quot;Give Us a Beautiful Day&quot;) and a special recognition of Marion Chrisner for forty years of musical excellence at The Grosse Pointe Academy. Marion, now in her 41st year, is the only teacher remaining who was on staff forty years ago.</p><p>The students then broke into assigned teams with group leaders for a scavenger hunt.&nbsp; Students were given clues such as &quot;I'm a larger room facing the lake / Visitors often will find cookies and cake / Come my way, and discover the past / It's an adventure guaranteed to be a blast!&quot; (You guessed it - the Lakeshore Parlor.) Students would then go to that particular location where they were greeted by a parent, alumni volunteer or faculty member who would talk about the site and provide historical anecdotes. (Unfortunately, due to the inclement weather, all stations had to be moved indoors.)</p><p>The afternoon concluded with another ASH tradition - <em>gout&eacute;r</em>, or snack. Ask your child to tell you about the special surprise and share the handout they were given on the history of the school!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the ninth consecutive year, students in grades 1-5 participated in the CATCH Fun Run as part of GPA's ongoing commitment to community service. CATCH stands for Caring Athletes Team for Children's and Henry Ford Hospitals. Due to the school's continuing loyalty and commitment to the CATCH organization, several middle school students were asked to participate in the CATCH Night of Champions on October 14 at the Ritz Carlton Dearborn. Sixth grader Hannah Homsy and eighth graders Wade Penman and Karstan Minanov (pictured with CATCH Hall of Fame inductee and Detroit Lions placekicker Jason Hansen) served as emcees at the annual fundraiser. The students received many compliments from attendees for their impressive performance. </p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091023105742.jpg" /></center><p><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><strong><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091106110536.jpg" /></strong></center><p><strong>Kate Baudeloque</strong> is a familiar face at the Academy, in particular to Action Auction parent volunteers. She has helped out with the Auction on and off for over ten years. However, two years ago she came on board as a steady presence during the Auction busy season, and this fall she joined the teaching staff as the K-1 art teacher. (Rosi Triano, who previously taught K-5 art, is now teaching Grades 2-8).<br /></p><p>It is a natural fit for Kate, who has a degree from the Center for Creative Studies in graphic design, with a minor in art therapy. </p><p>&ldquo;The transition to teaching has been a pleasant surprise,&rdquo; Kate admits, due, in large part, to the &ldquo;incredible support&rdquo; she has received from the faculty, in particular Rosi. Kate also enjoys her interactions with the students. &ldquo;I love coming here, seeing the kids, starting a new project with them, witnessing their ideas and what each child has brought to the project. No two are ever the same.&rdquo; </p><p>The K-1 art curriculum has included working with primary colors, using different line construction, creating 3-D paper collages, paper weaving, and studying the Lascaux cave drawings and Alexander Calder mobiles. Many projects are on display in the Early School, first grade wing and Valade Art Loft &amp; Gallery. </p><p>Kate&rsquo;s favorite part of the job?&#8200;&ldquo;I enjoy observing the process with the children, seeing it go from concept to final product. That is probably the most rewarding part of an art teacher&rsquo;s day.&rdquo; </p><p>New Spanish teacher <strong>Sarah Brown,</strong> a graduate of Notre Dame who received her Master&rsquo;s degree from the University of Pennsylvania, has dedicated her nine-year teaching career to working primarily in an urban public school environment. Coming to The Grosse Pointe Academy has, therefore, been a big transition for her. The biggest difference, in her observation, is the class size.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like the small class sizes,&rdquo; says Sarah. &ldquo;They enable me to do so many things I wasn&rsquo;t able to do in my previous teaching situations.&rdquo; </p><p>For example, when she taught Spanish for four years at a public high school in Seattle, she was responsible for five classes a day, with 30 students per class. </p><p>&ldquo;With 30 students in a class you have 30 different learning styles. We practiced inclusion, so there were students at all different levels. The small class sizes at the Academy are amazing. I feel like I really get to personalize instruction for each student.&rdquo; </p><p>Her class sizes vary, from three in her seventh grade class to 15 in her beginning Spanish class for grade 5.</p><p>&ldquo;I really enjoy teaching the beginners,&rdquo; Sarah says. &ldquo;&#8200;I feel I can provide them with a foundation that they will carry with them for the rest of their language experience. The beginners are like sponges. They are so eager to learn!&rdquo; </p><p>After graduating from Central Michigan University in 2007, 4/5 teacher <strong>Trevor Clor</strong> completed his student teaching in a fifth grade classroom in Grosse Pointe. He also did some long-term substitute teaching in Grosse Pointe, and last year taught sixth grade at a charter school in Hamtramck. </p><p>When comparing his last year of teaching to his first few months at The Grosse Pointe Academy, however, the differences are too numerous to count. The most important differences to Trevor, however, are the amount of parent involvement he enjoys, student motivation he observes, and administration and faculty support he receives at The Grosse Pointe Academy versus his experiences at the charter school.</p><p>&ldquo;I love teaching here,&rdquo; says Trevor. &ldquo;The atmosphere is great, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the parents are more than willing to help in any way they can. And the students are courteous, eager to learn and enthusiastic. You also can&rsquo;t beat the grounds! The last few days I watched the sun rise over the lake as I drove to school. It was so beautiful, I almost wished my drive to work took longer.&rdquo; </p><p>In addition to his fourth grade class, Trevor teaches 4/5 science along with Bob Lapadot. In a current unit on force and motion, the students built connect cars. They will also be studying electricity and measurement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sixth Graders Present Comparative Lit Workshops</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091106163927.jpg" align="left" border="0" alt="" />For the past several weeks in their language arts classes, GPA sixth grade students, together with Mrs. Whitaker and Dr. Blau, have studied myths, legends, folktales, fables, and fairytales from around the world. Students have read selections from each of these genres and have discussed at length the similarities and differences they have discovered within each genre as well as across various genres, time periods, and cultures. The roles of men and women in medieval times as portrayed in fairytales, the key elements of any hero's journey, and the qualities characteristic of heroes were among the topics explored in depth.</p><p>Following this in-depth study, each sixth grader was invited to select a subtopic within one of these genres to research so as to become a &quot;specialist&quot; on his or her specific, self-chosen topic. After an additional week of focused research, each student created a 10-minute workshop for presentation to the fourth and fifth grade students. Last Friday, October 30, the fourth and fifth grade students received a brochure listing all student workshop topics along with brief descriptions of each one.&nbsp;They were each allowed to select five workshops they would most like to attend. After careful planning and much cooperation from fourth, fifth, and sixth grade teachers alike, the sixth graders held their workshops on Wednesday, November 3 from 9:15 - 9:55 in the Tracy Fieldhouse. There were three sessions with multiple presentations of each workshop by the sixth graders so that the fourth and fifth graders were able to attend a total of three workshops of their choice.</p><p>Says Dr. Blau of the project: &quot;The teachers and students alike were so impressed with the wide variety of topics, level of detailed knowledge, and creative presentation techniques that the sixth graders implemented when sharing what they had learned with the fourth and fifth graders.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="" align="left" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091113135648.jpg" />&ldquo;If you are good at a lot of subjects in school but don&rsquo;t know how to choose just one, then a career in foreign service might be just the thing for you.&rdquo; These were words of advice from Grosse Pointe Academy 1991 graduate Kate Van Til Rebholz, who spoke on November 9 to fourth through eighth grade students during their Monday morning assembly. </p><p>Kate, a 1999 graduate of Amherst College who majored in anthropology, decided to pursue a career in diplomacy after traveling through Europe on a Watson Fellowship. She was awarded the fellowship after graduating from Amherst and was given a year to do an independent study of her choosing abroad. Her study was on Neolithic remains (i.e., remains from the cultural period of the Stone Age beginning around 10,000 B.C. in the Middle East and later elsewhere, characterized by the development of agriculture and the making of polished stone implements). She discovered in her travels that she was far more interested in the people she met and the cultures she discovered than she was in looking at large rocks. </p><p>Kate started the process of applying for a job with the State Department while she was getting her M.B.A. at the University of Michigan Business School. After passing the foreign service test, completing the oral exam process, and undergoing extensive background checks (&ldquo;They needed to make sure I was fit to represent the U.S.,&rdquo; Kate explains), she was ultimately offered a job. Her first assignment was in India, where she met her husband, Jason, a foreign service officer on his second assignment after previously serving in South Korea. </p><p>After a two-year post, Kate and her husband were assigned to Indonesia, and the couple currently resides in Jakarta. Before beginning her assignment Kate underwent intense language training to become fluent in Indonesian. (Intense language training involves five days a week of nine-hour classes and an additional three hours of homework or lab for nine months.) Kate, who, by her own admission, is &ldquo;an average language learner,&rdquo; may ultimately learn as many as three languages over the course of her career. </p><p>In speaking with the Academy students, Kate emphasized how exciting her job is, with every day bringing new challenges, be it writing a speech for the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, or figuring out how to get a monkey out of her apartment. She is currently expecting her first child and is home in Grosse Pointe for the duration of her pregnancy before returning to Jakarta. Living overseas is &ldquo;a fabulous cultural experience&rdquo; that she and Jason hope to share with their children. </p><p>Kate enjoyed the opportunity to visit the Academy, meet with the students (in addition to her morning presentation, she spoke with eighth grade social studies classes), and catch up with former teachers. When reflecting on her days as an Academy student, she recalls music classes with Marion Chrisner and the Academy Adventures trips with Michael Fultz with particular fondness. Perhaps it was the summer camping trips that sparked some of her adventurous spirit! &ldquo;The summer trips provided such a great opportunity to experience the natural world,&rdquo; she says. She also had math with Scott Tily.</p><p>&ldquo;I am really glad to have the opportunity to come back to the Academy and share my experiences,&quot; Kate says. &quot;You don&rsquo;t realize growing up that the world is as big as it is, and I hope to open the students&rsquo; eyes to that.&rdquo; Kate also hopes to plant a seed in the minds of possible future diplomats. &ldquo;This is finally a recruiting effort,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I would love to have smart Academy students grow up and do diplomacy abroad someday. It really is a rewarding career.&rdquo; </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, November 12, the Academy third grade embarked on a historical walk that covered approximately 6,000 years, beginning when Native Americans came into this region from the Northeast. This tour, which is part of the students' social studies curriculum and includes a map skills unit, highlighted 15 points of interest, including the Nun's Walk, Grant's Castle, Joy Estate, Old Brook Lane, the Provencal-Weir House, and old farm houses and summer homes. The students learned about the establishment of Michigan as a state, the Native American tribes, ribbon farming, the heritage of The Grosse Pointe Academy, and business development of the Grosse Pointes.<br /><br /><br /></p><center><center></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091113143731.jpg" /></center></center><p>The tour concluded at St. Paul's Cemetery, where parent&nbsp;Laura Jamieson, accompanied by an actor, &ldquo;Mr. Renaud,&rdquo; took the children to different headstones to discuss Grosse Pointe and family development in this area. The children made rubbings of some artwork on the headstones. These and their stories from the day are displayed in the hallway, and the experience will be captured on a DVD, complete with photos, video and voiceover, for the enjoyment of third grade parents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091113143718.jpg" /></center><center></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourth and fifth grade students, as part of their study on Native Americans in social studies class, created Native American Museums that were on display in the Fisher Library. Divided into groups of two or three, the students selected Native American tribes from a hat which they then researched.

They discovered interesting facts such as they made their moccasins out of one piece of buckskin and would stuff them with grass for warmth, that they lived in different types of houses depending on the season, and that one of these house types was built at least three feet into the ground. For their museum they made a cradle basket, moccassins, a woven basket, an earth lodge, and samples of foods that the Maidu Indians would eat, such as acorn, seeds, roots, rabbit, deer and fish.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sixth and seventh grade students have been working on Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; choreography during music class for the past few weeks, and on Friday they had the opportunity to perform in front of an audience. After this visual treat, music teacher Marion Chrisner asked audience members to close their eyes for the next number. The seventh graders, directed by Jack Weaver, choreographed the sounds of a rainstorm, beginning with a soft sprinkle, escalating into a downpour, and then trickling to a close with intermittent raindrops. Those who peeked during the performance witnessed that this was all achieved through the simple use of clapping, rubbing hands together, drumming on knees - all, according to Mrs. Chrisner, a result of their own imagination, creativity and ingenuity. The performance ended to &quot;thunderous&quot; applause. <br /><br /></p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091120150733.jpg" /></center>]]></content:encoded>

The singing of Christmas carols, a strings performance under the direction of Lynne Bacon, the telling of the Christmas story with a depiction of the nativity scene by third graders, and performances on chimes, drums and finger cymbals under the direction of music teacher Roshell Chuhran heralded the advent of the Christmas season.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Has anyone here ever felt like a loser?&rdquo; asked Sean Hogan-Downey, LMSW, LMFT. </p><p>Hands went up around the room. Present were 4/5 students and their parents. They were participating in a book group discussion facilitated by Sean, who is a licensed master social worker and a licensed marriage and family therapist as well as the Academy&rsquo;s school counselor and staff consultant. </p><p>The book being discussed was <em>Loser</em>, by Jerry Spinelli. Parents read the books with their children and attended a book discussion on Thursday, December 10. The central theme of the book involved social issues surrounding friendship. The protagonist, Zinkoff, was perceived by his peers as a &ldquo;loser&rdquo; because, according to one student, &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t the best at anything so he wasn&rsquo;t seen as important as someone who was the best at something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t he try really hard?&rdquo; countered Sean. &ldquo;And he wasn&rsquo;t a quitter.&rdquo; </p><p>Sean cited her favorite line in the book as follows: &ldquo;Big-kid eyes replace little-kid eyes. &ldquo;You need big eyes to see the meaning behind things,&rdquo; explained Sean. &ldquo;With big eyes you notice more. You ask more questions. You become more critical and judgmental.&rdquo; </p><p>The students talked about what they learned from the book and from Zinkoff. They also discussed what they would want to do differently as a result of reading the book. </p><p>&ldquo;I can be happy when things are tough,&rdquo; said one student. </p><p>&ldquo;Even if the person is kind of different, I should still be nice to them because they could turn out to be a really nice person,&rdquo; said another. </p><p>&ldquo;I would be more open to people because Zinkoff was open to people,&rdquo; said another. </p><p>Sean&rsquo;s closing advice to students was as follows: &ldquo;The next time you meet a person who is different, just think of Zinkoff. I think it might help.&rdquo; <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Julie Sheeren and her daughter, fourth grader Elizabeth, delivered books on Wednesday, December 8 to George Crocket Academy, a K-8 school in West Detroit. The books were donated in support of a project initiated by the students in Trevor Clor's class as a way to encourage the love of reading with those who are less fortunate. <br /><br />Explains Julie: &quot;Many of the students at George Crocket do not have books of their own at home, so our kids decided to donate a new or gently used book that they personally enjoyed.&quot; The children then made book marks, with statements like &quot;I loved this book because it is an adventure&quot; or &quot;Enjoy this book! My favorite part was...&quot; All of the 4/5 classes participated in the book collection and over 80 books with bookmarks were collected. In addition, four large bags of beautiful picture books and readers were donated by GPA families along with nine large boxes of non-fiction books from the GPA library. &quot;Needless to say, our minivan was full!&quot; said Julie. <br /><br />Fifth grade teacher Ms. Dasaro told Julie that many teachers do not have adequate classroom libraries, so these books will be helpful to add directly to the classrooms. Her fifth grade boys helped to carry the books to their second floor classroom, and Elizabeth had a chance to meet the students and field some questions about her school and community. </p><p align="center"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20091211134634.JPG" /></p><p>Says Julie: &quot;The students could not believe that other children gave their own books and the bookmark, too. They were truly moved by the love and generosity.&quot;<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students at The Grosse Pointe Academy were challenged to help with the relief efforts in the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti by bringing in loose change to fill jars placed in every classroom. The final tally of the amount collected has not yet taken place, but students and faculty have rallied to the challenge, and all the money collected by the end of the week will be donated to the Red Cross. <br /><br />Faculty and staff members enjoyed a &quot;jeans day&quot; in exchange for a $5 contribution, and students have been showing up at school all week with loose change jingling in their pockets. Homeroom advisors Wendy Jerome and Sasha Murphy issued a special challenge to seventh graders: If the students filled three jars with loose change in 48 hours, Mrs. Jerome and Mrs. Murphy would either clean lunch tables in the cafeteria for a week, or wear the school uniform, based on a majority vote.<br /><br /><br /></p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100121141222.jpg" /></center><p><br />The seventh graders not only met the challenge, they exceeded it, according to Middle School Principal Scott Tily. They managed to fill five jars.&nbsp;&ldquo;Community service is a vital part of our program here at the Academy,&rdquo; said Scott. &ldquo;This is just one more example of our students stepping up to help others.&rdquo; <br /><br />The question remains, however: now that the students have met their challenge, will Mrs. Murphy and Mrs. Jerome be cleaning lunch tables next week, or donning the school uniform? <br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

In French class with Madame Leslie, they listened to the story, <em>The Little Mermaid,</em> and learned the vocabulary for the most common animals that live in the ocean. In addition to creating a book that displays all the creatures they learned about, they expressed sentences with their newly developed vocabulary. In Christian Life with Mrs. Baetens, the children read the story, <em>Jonah and the Whale.</em><br /><br />To tie all of these pieces together, music teacher Roshell Chuhran selected &ldquo;The Aquarium&rdquo; from the French composer, Camille Saint-Saens, to create a living aquarium using the artwork the students created along with their French studies. <br /><br />The culminating activity for this program was when the students presented their work for parents on Friday, February&nbsp;19 in the Tracy Fieldhouse. The children introduced themselves and their sea creatures in French and performed a sea-inspired choreography.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Tuesday, February 23 and Wednesday, February 24, the students participated in St. Paul's program for the homeless by serving breakfast beginning at 6:15 a.m. They also had the opportunity to talk to the guests before breakfast was served.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourth and fifth graders culminated their study of the American Colonial period with a visit to the Provencal-Weir House in Grosse Pointe Farms. The children dressed for the day in Colonial attire. Having made vests and bonnets in class, they then completed their costumes at home. The girls wore long skirts and shawls with their bonnets, and the boys wore knickers, long socks and caps with their vests.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100305135103.jpg" /></center><p>The students participated in a number of activities that helped prepare them for their visit to the one-room schoolhouse. For example, in art class with Mrs. Triano, the students learned about colonial crafts and used their imaginations to create their own versions of these crafts. They made cornhusk people and designed clothing and accessories for them. They also learned about tin punching and how it was used for functional items such as lanterns and foot warmers. Finally, they worked with types of Colonial claywork such as red ware and sponge ware. They each made a plate out of the red terra cotta clay, creating their own stencils and sponging a design in the center of the plate. For the sponge ware, students studied pictures of sponge ware plates, bowls and pitchers. They rolled out white clay and used cookie cutters to create Christmas ornaments that they then decorated with a sponge dipped in blue or green.</p><p>In addition, in social studies class, each student chose one of the thirteen original colonies to research and examine using information books, maps, encyclopedias, the class text book, and Internet sites. From their notes on the facts they gathered, the students prepared a brief oral description for their classmates. Aspects of the presentation included family life, clothing, food, houses, entertainment (toys and games), and education. Their study of Colonial school life particularly prepared them for what to expect in the day of a life of a student during Colonial times. </p><p>&quot;One thing the children particularly looked forward to was experiencing the type of discipline teachers used back in those days,&quot; said 4/5 social studies teacher Marsha Thomas. &quot;We taught them how strict teachers were in the one room schoolhouse. The rules were well known to everyone and enforcement of the rules was fair and firm.&quot; These forms of discipline included critizing a student, whipping with a hickory stick, or having the student sit on the dunce chair wearing a dunce hat.</p><p>Teachers and students alike enjoyed the role playing! Activities at the one-room school house included performing tongue twisters, participating in a spelling bee, reciting memory verses, doing arithmetic, practicing their penmanship, eating lunch, and playing games at recess.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>4/5 Students Discover Scientific Method</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Grosse Pointe Academy fourth and fifth graders participated in the sixth annual Science Fair this winter, the culmination of which was a parent evening on Wednesday, March 10 during which attendees had the opportunity to view all the display boards in the library while the young scientists were on hand to explain their methods and procedures.</p><p>Grade 4/5 teachers Trevor Clor and Bob Lapadot led the project during science classes. They began by teaching the scientific method (stating the problem, forming a hypothesis, listing the materials and procedures, recording observations, and forming a conclusion). Working under the guidance of their teachers, students conducted some of the work for their projects in class and the remainder at home to meet specific deadlines throughout the process.</p><p>Fifth grade projects were entered into a competition, with middle school science teachers serving as judges. Special certificates of recognition were awarded to the top four fifth grade projects. </p><p align="center"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100312142433.jpg" /></p><p align="left">Congratulations go to winning scientists David Scupholm, Bridget Donaldson, Emma Andreasen and Markus Minanov. In &quot;SuperBall Air Cannon,&quot; David addressed the question of how angle affects trajectory. He discovered that the lower the angle of trajectory, the farther a superball will launch. Bridget, in an effort to determine whether gas can be generated from waste, looked into which waste source releases the most natural gas: cow manure, cow manure and mashed bananas, or cow manure and vegetable peelings. Emma investigated whether a dog, cat or human has a cleaner mouth (the answer is that a cat's mouth has the most bacteria, and a dog's the least). Finally, Markus's burning question had to do whether the color of a candle's wax affects the rate at which it burns. He discovered that, in fact, the candles burned at the same rate regardless of color.</p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The criterion was that, with the exception of plastic wheels, the car was to be constructed entirely of paper.</p><p>The students conducted a series of time trials with their cars, first to determine the fastest car without an egg, and second to determine the fastest car that made it down the ramp with the egg still intact. There was also a design component to the assignment.</p><p>Awards were given out at the conclusion of the project for fastest car without the egg, fastest &quot;crash test&quot; egg car, and outstanding car design (as determined by an independent judge, art teacher Mrs. Triano). For the fastest car without an egg, the award went to McCalla Mecke. George Spica won the egg car crash contest, and Jared Brush received the award for outstanding car design.</p><p align="center"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100312153433.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First graders learned some valuable lessons about being good neighbors during the delightful performance of &quot;This Old Gingerbread House&quot; on Thursday evening. The story picked up where the traditional Hans Christian Andersen fable leaves off: Hansel and Gretel have successfully done away with the wicked witch and are enjoying life in the gingerbread house. Unfortunately, inconsiderate neighbors eat their house, but they quickly express their remorse and, with the help of Bob Vila from &quot;This Old House,&quot; work together to make the yummy home as good as new! The story, under the direction of music teacher Roshell Chuhran, was narrated by the students with the help of lively song and dance.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100312153321.jpg" /></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During a Chapel assembly on Monday, May 3, The Grosse Pointe Academy recognized the second through eighth grade students who received the top scores in the Continental Math League competition.</p><p>The winners were Claire Sheeren (grade 2), Adrian Doan (grade 3), Ian Homsy (grade 4), David Scupholm (grade 5), Jack Sheeren and Alexander Minanov (grade 6), James Scott (grade 7), and Sheridan Reilly (grade 8).</p><p>The Continental Math League is a nationally sponsored mathematical competition. Students are challenged to solve six difficult problems in thirty minutes. Each correct answer is worth one point. The problems are designed to encourage students to use a variety of problem solving techniques in the areas of mathematical and visual problem solving.</p><p>This marks the fifth year that Academy students in grades 2-8 have participated in the Continental Math League competition. Grades 2 and 3 have three meets while grades 4-8 have five meets. The top six scores at each grade are sent in to the CML headquarters in New Jersey. </p><p>&ldquo;The world of math is changing,&rdquo; said grade 4/5 teacher Wendy Demartini, who brought the CML competition to the Academy several years ago. &ldquo;It used to be that rote repetition of math facts was considered to be the goal of math instruction. In today&rsquo;s world, math instruction focuses on understanding concepts and then applying those concepts to solving real world problems.&rdquo; <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">&quot;Wouldn't it be loverly&quot; if 42 sixth and seventh grade students could gather together for an evening's performance, each with a speaking part, each with a dancing part, each with a solo to sing? Had you been in the audience on Thursday evening for &quot;A Bit of Broadway,&quot; you would &quot;consider yourself&quot; very lucky indeed and, in &quot;reviewing the situation,&quot; might have concluded that director Marion Chrisner outdid herself in managing to pull off three plays in one evening - &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; &quot;Oliver&quot; and &quot;Guys and Doll&quot; (the missing &quot;s&quot; is intentional), adapting each in length and content to fit the particular cast of characters made of up GPA's sixth and seventh graders.</p><p align="left">&quot;In the middle school, it is especially important that kids develop a sense of self-worth and become more confident in their own abilities,&quot; explained Marion. &quot;It is my personal philosophy that one of the ways that students can develop these attributes is by performing in front of others. Performing means trusting in others to support you and participate with you to create a worthy product.&quot;</p><p align="center"><strong>&quot;MY FAIR LADY&quot;</strong></p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430120841.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430120859.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430120944.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430120959.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121011.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121025.jpg" /></center><center></center><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="center">&quot;OLIVER&quot;</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121229.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121239.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121251.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121306.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121319.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121414.jpg" /></center><center></center><center>&quot;GUYS AND DOLL&quot;</center><center></center><center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121642.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121712.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121728.jpg" /></center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121747.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121801.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121851.jpg" /><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100430121920.jpg" /></center></center></center></center></center></center></center></center></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy, recently named a Michigan Green School, embarked on an especially ambitious celebration of Earth Day this year, expanding it into Earth Week 2010. </p><p>&ldquo;This is a great opportunity for us to teach the students about what they can do to be green at home and here at school,&rdquo; said Sasha Murphy, who spearheaded the school&rsquo;s green program. </p><p>On Monday, April 19, every student and teacher was given an Earth Day sticker to wear. Grades 1-5 were given an on-line carbon footprint activity to complete followed by some &ldquo;green&rdquo; class discussions, and sixth through eighth graders were given the site to use in math class. </p><p>On Tuesday, teachers talked with their classes about how to conserve energy. &ldquo;We asked the students to set a goal each day of the week as to what they would try to do,&rdquo; explained Sasha. &ldquo;Maybe they could turn lights off at home, or help their parents change light bulbs to CF bulbs. Maybe they could encourage their parents to do laundry with cold water, or only run the dishwasher when it&rsquo;s full.&rdquo; </p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100504131020.jpg" /></center><p>Wednesday was walk, bike or carpool to school day. &ldquo;At lunchtime, I heard the students plotting where they would meet and what route they would take to school,&rdquo; said Sasha. Many teachers also participated, some carpooling, and others, like Christian Life teacher Ellen Krease, riding their bikes. According to Sasha&rsquo;s count, there were over 60 bicycles in the bike rack, and approximately 20 students walked to school and another 20 carpooled. </p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100504131138.jpg" align="left" border="0" alt="" />On Wednesday during lunch, fourth through eighth grade students were surprised when they went to bus their trays. Rather than throwing their waste in the trash, students emptied their plates into buckets that were then weighed.</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted to see how many pounds of food we are wasting,&rdquo; explained Sasha. After the initial surprise, students had the opportunity during Thursday and Friday&rsquo;s lunch to reduce their amount of waste, with the goal to reach zero waste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On Thursday, the second grade enjoyed a visit from Arts and Scraps, a Detroit non-profit organization that uses recycled industrial materials to help students think, create and learn. The children created a variety of unique and environmentally safe forms of transportation out of scraps.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100504131441.jpg" /></center><p>Earth Week concluded on Friday with a paper drive, the final day of measuring food waste after lunch, and the continuation of discussions and journal entries. </p><p>There were many other class activities prior to Earth Week and many that will follow. For example, Mrs. Stepanek&rsquo;s third grade class discussed global warming and the greenhouse effect and conducted an experiment growing lentils in a hydroponic solution. They also made posters with recommendations to make the world a better place.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100504131512.jpg" align="left" border="0" alt="" />Beth Plotzke&rsquo;s Early School students enjoyed a two-week discussion about how every day is Earth Day. Mrs. Beth gave each student a sugar maple sapling to take home to plant in honor of Earth Day. The class also planted a sapling by the Early School building.</p><p>&ldquo;We planted it in the perfect spot,&rdquo; said Beth. &ldquo;We can see it from our classroom window, and many years from now it will provide shade and beautiful fall foliage for future Early School children.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the fourth consecutive year, Grosse Pointe Academy middle school students participated in the National French Contest Exam (also known as <em>Le Grand Concours</em>), with fourteen students receiving medals for their high scores and achievements. This 60-minute national examination is developed and managed by the American Association of Teachers of French. Its purpose is to help stimulate further interest in the teaching and learning of French as well as to help identify and reward student achievement. <br /><br />The exam is a multiple-choice test of approximately 70 items covering listening comprehension, vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Students took the test that was appropriate for the French curriculum in which they are enrolled. Their scores were then ranked against students locally as well as nationally who are enrolled in similar curricula.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100521110610.jpg" /></center><p>Competing against both middle school and high school students, the following Academy middle school students placed in the top 10 ranks both in the Metro Detroit Chapter and nationally: eighth graders Kate Van Pelt (#2 chapter ranking and #6 national ranking), Kara French (#3 chapter ranking and #7 national ranking), Jennifer Vermet (#4 chapter ranking and #8 national ranking), and Luiza Wasilewski (#5 chapter ranking and #9 national ranking); and seventh graders Nikolas Minanov (#1 chapter ranking and #7 national ranking) and James Scott (#2 chapter ranking and #8 national ranking). <br /><br />Sixth graders took the FLES exam, which includes a speaking section as well. Students are only ranked nationally for this exam. All of the Academy&rsquo;s sixth grade French students placed in the top 10 ranks, as follows: Sophia Engstrom (#5), Alexander Minanov (#5), Leonie Leslie (#6), Brynne Reilly (#6), Abby Kuplicki (#7), Rachel Lannen (#7), Anna Crane (#8) and Grace Drettmann (#8). <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hear ye! Hear ye! By order of the king, sixth graders ruled the school on Friday as they closed their study of the Middle Ages with the traditional sixth grade medieval feast. <br /><br />The event began with the grand entrance of the king, accompanied by squires and a priest. Students were divided into manor groups with a lord or lady as the head of the manor. They competed for farthings, and the manor with the most farthings was granted the head table. Those who sat below the salt were seated according to their rank. <br /><br /><img align="left" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100521113524.jpg" />King Fultz greeted the guests as they entered the &ldquo;manor on the lake&rdquo; &ndash; the Academy&rsquo;s Lakeshore building &ndash; then conducted a knighting ceremony. The students played the roles of knights, monks, priests, lords and ladies of the land, and pages. They also provided entertainment as jugglers, jesters, dancers, magicians and musicians. Several &ldquo;serving wenches&rdquo; (i.e., mothers of the sixth graders dressed in costume) prepared and served the food. After each course was announced, two food tasters sampled the food to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t poisoned. Judgments were announced for evil deeds, with the priest begging for mercy for the evildoer. The folks in the gallery decided whether that person should be freed or sent to the dungeon. <br /><br />Contributing to the ambiance of the banquet were family crests and banners that the students created. Throughout the afternoon, students from other grade levels stopped in to observe the festivities. <br /><br />Thursday of Medieval Week was &quot;Monk Day.&quot; The students experienced the monastic life of the middle ages as they meditated in the Chapel, ate only bread and water, and slept in cells with only a single sheet of newspaper for a blanket. Any monks who broke the code of silence had to wear a hair shirt in penance. </p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100521113707.jpg" /></center><p>The students were given a respite from their study of the Middle Ages on Thursday afternoon when they enjoyed a Poetry Caf&eacute;. While each student read from his or her poetry journal (a selection of free verse, limericks, haiku, acrostics and many others), classmates lounged on pillows and ate snacks while snapping their fingers to demonstrate their approval of their peers' work.<br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Sixth graders also had their own field day, testing their abilities to work together as a team in a variety of fun activities and competitions.

Each event marked a special milestone or rite of passage, whether it was the seventh graders taking the pews along the sides of the Chapel traditionally reserved for the eighth graders during Monday morning Chapel assemblies, or the third grade teachers bidding farewell to the leaders of the lower school who will be entering the 4/5 program next year. Kindergarten parents celebrated another milestone for their children&nbsp; who will be leaving the Early School and beginning a new journey next year as first graders.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20100622120712.jpg" /></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy Action Auction celebrated the 60&rsquo;s in high style on May 5 and 8. The &ldquo;Salute to the 60&rsquo;s&rdquo; was evident in decorations, food and drink selections, and even the evening&rsquo;s attire, from the wait staff to the attendees.<br /><br />On Wednesday, May 5, over 300 items were offered in a silent auction. The merchandise was artfully displayed to catch the bidder&rsquo;s eye, with bids displayed on plasma screens to allow guests to move throughout the Tracy Fieldhouse to enjoy the many offerings. The d&eacute;cor was a colorful throwback to the 60&rsquo;s with mod seating arrangements, peace signs and lava lights in abundance. Delicious theme-inspired food stations allowed guests to dine and bid at the same time. <br /><br />On Saturday, May 8, the night&rsquo;s event showcased another 200+ silent auction items to get the bidding started for the evening.<br /><br />A sumptuous buffet dinner was served, followed by the start of the main event - the live Action Auction. Kim Adams entertained the crowd as Mistress of Ceremonies and the DuMouchelle family served as auctioneers of the live auction, which offered an exciting selection of 42 impressive items, from once-in-a-lifetime adventures like an Alaskan family cruise, a week in a Tuscan villa or Paris apartment, or an exclusive Napa Valley wine tour, to exquisite jewelry, parties, original artwork, landscaping packages and even an opportunity to get a sneak peek at what happens backstage at a Caroline Herrera fashion show. The Tracy Fieldhouse was transformed once again into an elegant dining and event space, 60&rsquo;s style.<br /><br />Presenting corporate sponsors of Action Auction 2010 were Airfoil, Health Plan of Michigan and Woodworth, among many corporate sponsors and item donors who helped make the evening a success. The over $430,000 net proceeds raised at Action Auction 2010 help to fund academic enrichment activities, scholarships and the preservation of the beautiful historic campus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Middle school students gathered in the student dining hall to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and assemble over 700 brown bag meals to be delivered to St. Joseph Church in Detroit for needy families. Special thanks go to all of the parents who donated food, bottled water and supplies for what was truly a community effort.</font></p><center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20101022141906.jpg" /></center></center><p><font size="2">Earlier this month community service coordinator Sasha Murphy organized a contest in which students came up with suggestions for a community service slogan.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a few months&rsquo; experience behind them in the 2010-11 school year, new Grosse Pointe Academy teachers Didi DeBoer, Connie Irueta and Yandan Wang have settled into their daily routines and are now able to reflect on what the experience of teaching at the Academy has meant to them so far.</p><p align="center"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20101112144748.jpg" /></p><p><strong>Didi DeBoer</strong> may be new to the 4/5 program at GPA, but she is not new to teaching. She comes to the Academy with seven years of experience as a substitute teacher in the Grosse Pointe public school system and three years as a second grade teacher at Great Oaks Academy in Warren.</p><p>Didi describes her three years at Great Oaks Academy, a charter school, as &ldquo;a wonderful experience. I loved working there and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade those three years for the world. It was a tough decision to leave, but when the opportunity arose here, I was so grateful. I was very excited to be able to teach in the community where I live.&rdquo;</p><p>Didi has found the Academy to be &ldquo;like a family. People really care about each other. Everyone knows one another. I love the small classes, the fact that you can work individually with students. We have all the tools here you could possibly want: intelligent, pleasant kids, supportive parents, fabulous staff and an incredible facility.&rdquo;</p><p>In her first year here at GPA, Didi is jumping in with both feet. In addition to helping out with the after school forensics program, Didi will be coaching the girls&rsquo; basketball team this winter.</p><p>&ldquo;I am basically a Detroiter,&rdquo; says Spanish teacher <strong>Connie Irueta</strong>. Born in Cuba, she attended a Catholic school run by Dominican nuns from New Orleans, where she was taught English from the first grade on. When she was nine, her family came to the United States one month before the missile crisis. Like many other Cubans fleeing the Castro administration, her family initially came to Miami and then were relocated to Detroit as part of a family adoption program. There Connie attended the All Saints&rsquo; Catholic School on Ford Street.</p><p>Connie graduated from Holy Redeemer, then attended Marygove College in the 1970s before transferring to Wayne State University, where she changed her major from art to Spanish literature.<br />Her teaching background includes teaching Spanish as part of a bilingual program to middle and high school students. Most recently she taught at the Detroit School of Arts. &ldquo;There was lots of drama in my classroom!&rdquo;&#8200;she jokes. After thirty years of teaching in the public school system, she retired last June. Her retirement was short-lived.</p><p>&ldquo;I considered subbing or starting a Spanish club,&rdquo; Connie recalls. &ldquo;Then I heard about the opportunity here and I couldn&rsquo;t resist.&rdquo;</p><p>Connie too loves the small classes and her ability to individualize her lessons. She also appreciates the students&rsquo; eagerness.</p><p>&ldquo;I like the fact that the students are giving. I enjoyed the sandwich making day. These are important traits that must be learned early in life and are reinforced here both at home and at school.&rdquo;</p><p>Mandarin Chinese teacher <strong>Yandan Wang</strong> moved to the United States three years ago from Liaoning Province in the northeast part of China.</p><p>Says Yandan: &ldquo;I&#8200;never imagined I could teach Chinese to foreigners when I was young. English was very popular in China. All the students wanted to learn English at the University.&rdquo;</p><p>Teaching Chinese to foreigners is exactly what she ended up doing, initially in China and now at Wayne State University and the Academy. She particularly enjoys teaching students about the Chinese culture. For example, fifth graders learned about Chinese fan dancing and seventh grade learned about Chinese brush pen painting. Eighth graders researched the mid-autumn festival in the library and then were able to discuss the holiday in class in Chinese.</p><p>Yandan has exposed the students to other native speakers, having invited visitors from the Confucius Institute at Wayne State to her classroom.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of our Green School certification, the sixth grade went on a field trip to Great Lakes Recycling Plant on Wednesday November 3. GLR&nbsp;is a state-of-the-art single stream recycling plant built in 2008, and located in New Boston, Michigan.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20101116131130.jpg" /></center><p>This was an excellent opportunity for our students to see &ldquo;the bigger picture&rdquo; since the sixth grade is in charge of GPA's paper recycling program. This field trip also served to reinforce responsibility (our October Pillar of Character) to our environment, as well as tie in with our science and geography units.</p><p>Students spent a couple of hours at the recycling plant, where they had a first-hand experience with the six main stages of recycling. They followed the recyclables from a big warehouse to the different sorting machines, all the way to the baling process.</p><p>Upon their return, the sixth graders made posters of the different recycling stages to share with the rest of the school. Make sure to stop by and take a look at the posters hanging in the second floor hallway!</p><p>Go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/">Flickr</a> to view pictures from the field trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy Parents' Coordinating Council is proud to sponsor a private screening of the award-winning documentary &quot;Race to Nowhere&quot; on Wednesday, January 12 at 7 p.m. in the Tracy Fieldhouse.</p><p>The film examines the pressures faced by American schoolchildren and their teachers in a system and culture obsessed with the illusion of achievement, competition and the pressure to perform. &quot;Race to Nowhere&quot; points to the silent epidemic in our schools: students have become disengaged and stress-related illnesses, depression and burnout are rampant.<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Race to Nowhere&quot; is a call to mobilize families, educators, and policy makers to challenge current assumptions on how to best prepare the youth of America to become healthy, bright, contributing and leading citizens. Check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbq6Cr1AQ7A">trailer</a> or call 313-886-1221 for more information.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

The audience participated in recreating some parts of the story, including an imaginary trip on the Underground Railroad. Rag dolls were used to help tell the story and illustrate the various ages of Harriet Tubman.</p><p>At 10:15 a.m., Leslie McCurdy created a different experience for students in grades 4-8, using costumes and a barren stage. She told Harriet's story in her own words, from her earliest experiences as a slave, through her work on the Underground Railroad, to her continued commitment to others in her later years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Jan. 6, in conjunction with their study of World War II, the seventh graders enjoyed a visit from a guest speaker, Mrs. Margaret Torp, who spoke to them about living just outside of London, England during the war.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110114115709.jpg" /></center><p>According to Harriett Whitaker, who arranged the visit for the student, Mrs. Torp was about the same age as the students and experienced things like blackout curtains, sleeping in bunkers, as well has having the windows of her home blown out by a blast while she and her brother played &ldquo;Snakes and Ladders&rdquo; in the livingroom.&nbsp; &quot;Luckily, we ducked just in time and were able to avoid injury!&quot; said Mrs. Torp.&nbsp;They had to have gas masks with them wherever they went, but never had to use them.&nbsp;Eventually some folks packed their lunches in them. Mrs. Torp&rsquo;s brother was a prisoner of war, so she talked about how stressful it was not knowing his whereabouts for six months or even if he was alive. Her family listened to the radio every night because that&rsquo;s how they got information about the war.</p><p>Mrs. Torp stressed to the students that there were good parts of the war as well, especially the camaraderie that developed within communities and time spent with family.&nbsp;Said Mrs. Whitaker about the visit: &quot;It was a nice treat for the students to be able to hear first hand Mrs. Torp&rsquo;s experience in World War II.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2">Fourth and fifth graders traveled to Lansing on Friday, January 28 as part of their social studies unit on Michigan government. They enjoyed lunch, a tour of the Capitol building and a visit to the Michigan Historical Museum. While at the Capitol building they were greeted by representatives from the offices of Tim Bledsoe and Senator Bert Johnson. The visit to the Michigan Historical Museum, led by docents, included a time-line of Michigan's history from the Ice Age to the 1960s.</font></p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110204151209.jpg" /></center><p><font size="2">To prepare for their trip, fourth graders in Mrs. DeBoer's social studies class studied branches of the Michigan government and role played how to create a bill. With half of the students on the Senate and half on the House of Representatives, they debated on issues like how to get extra time at recess and how to earn free time each day. Neither bill was passed along to the governor, Mrs. DeBoer. &quot;We had long debates but reached a stalemate. We plan to go back to session next week,&quot; Didi explained.</font></p><p><font size="2">Fifth graders in Mrs. Demartini's social studies class, who had learned about the federal government in preparation for the trip to Washington D.C. last spring, compared federal laws to state laws and differences in state and federal government, including numbers of senators and representatives. The fifth graders were particularly eager to visit the Capitol building in Lansing and compare it to their recollection of the federal Capitol building.</font></p>]]></content:encoded>

Beginning in homeroom classes with Mrs. Karle and Mrs. Martin, students selected a sea creature to study, conducted research in library class with Mrs. Baetens, went into depth about their creatures in enrichment classes with Dr. Blau, then created three-dimensional puppets using fluorescent paints in art class with Mrs. Baudeloque. During the presentation to parents on Thursday morning, their research and knowledge shone through their art as they introduced their creatures in French and presented them on stage under black light to the music of &quot;The Aquarium&quot; by French composer Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns.</p><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110218093319.jpg" /><br /><br /></center><center></center><center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110218093340.jpg" /><br /><br /></center><center></center><center><center><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110218093351.jpg" /></center></center></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><font size="2">As part of their unit on architecture, eighth graders have studied six architectural styles in art class with Mrs. Triano: Classical, Romanesque, Gothic, Mediterranean, Islamic and Modern. Having completed a project in which they&nbsp;identified houses in a variety of architectural styles in Grosse Pointe, they have been busy in the art loft creating an architectural model that is a replica of a famous building or an original creation of their own. Using foam core, papier mach&eacute;, tubes, tiles, cardboard or whatever materials they have at their disposal, the students have created a variety of structures, from a skyscraper with a viewable elevator and a castle with a moat, to a building with glass walls and a replica of the Eiffel Tower. Later the students will select a building in Detroit to research and present to the class.</font></p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110311132148.jpg" /></center>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In celebration of its designation as a &ldquo;Green School&rdquo; for a second consecutive year, The Grosse&#8200;Pointe Academy once again hosted a week-long observance of Earth Week, with a number of fun things planned in and outside the classrooms. Unfortunately, due to inclement weather on&#8200;Tuesday, the plan to walk/bike/carpool to school day was postponed. However, the other activities took place as planned. This included each student and faculty or staff member receiving an Earth Day sticker.<br /><br />Grades 1-5 worked on Earth Day packets throughout the week, while middle school students completed their carbon footprints during science class.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110503102118.jpg" /></center><p>Grades 1-3 wrote about Earth Day for their daily journals, while sixth graders, who have been responsible for collecting recycling bins through the school buildings all year, weighed each of the bins they collected before dumping the paper for pick-up. This week the school recycled 42 1/2 pounds of paper. &ldquo;This amounts to 42 and a half pounds of paper that will not be going into a landfill!!&rdquo;&#8200;said community service coordinator Sasha Murphy, who organized Earth Week for the school.<br /><br />Sasha gave a special &ldquo;shout-out&rdquo; to the&nbsp; third grade, which accomplished a rare feat during &ldquo;Waste Free Wednesday&rdquo; at lunchtime. The final weight of all their food waste was less than a pound. <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, April 16, sixteen Academy middle school students, along with GPA Chinese teacher, Yandan Wang, headed to the Birmingham Covington School in Bloomfield Township to participate in the third annual Michigan China Quiz Bowl, sponsored by The Confucius Institute at Wayne State University.<br /><br />The competition features quiz bowl style questions that pertain to Mandarin language learning and Chinese geography. The six divisions comprised for non-heritage learners include first, second and third year middle-school divisions and first, second and third year high-school divisions. A record-number 46 teams joined the competition this year, representing nine schools from across southeast Michigan.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110503102709.jpg" /></center><p>The Grosse Pointe Academy was represented by four teams competing in the middle school division, with all four teams advancing to the championship round and three teams bringing home first place trophies. The winning teams were made up of sixth graders Gabriela Cavataio, Carly Demkowicz, Jyen-ai Jones, Megan McCarren, Hailey McDonald and RaeAnne Woodman (Division 1); seventh graders Isabella Gierlinger, James Raudabaugh, Jack Sheeren and Evelyn Woodman (Division 2); and eighth graders Joseph Cavataio, Matthew Homsy, R.J. McCarren and Michael Schaller (Division 3). The two GPA eighth grade teams faced each other in the finals, with Joseph, Matt, R.J. and Michael winning first place and Charles Becker, Jared Brush, McCalla Mecke and Jack Weaver taking home a second place trophy.<br /><br />&ldquo;The Michigan China Quiz Bowl is offered as an enjoyable incentive for students of Chinese language and culture to realize their accomplishments,&rdquo; said John Brender, Director of the Wayne State University Confucius Institute. &ldquo;Learning a foreign language &ndash; and especially Chinese &ndash; will bring many future rewards, but the initial thrill of putting together sentences and communicating in a foreign language is a milestone that we are extremely happy to acknowledge with this event.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Presentations to the class included a visual, and each student took notes on the presentations.</p><p>&quot;They were very impressive with all their knowledge,&quot; commented fifth grade teacher Bob Lapadot. Fourth grade teacher Didi DeBoer pointed out that during their carriage tour of Mackinac Island, the tour guide allowed the students&nbsp;to share their knowledge. &quot;She was very impressed with all that they knew!&quot; said Didi.</p><p>Highlights of the trip included the Grand Hotel (which, according to Mrs. DeBoer's students, was built in three months), Fort Michilimackinac, the Soo Locks, Mackinac Bridge, Hartwick Pines and Historic Mill Creek. Regarding Hartwick Pines, fourth grader Jackie Mercier claimed that she felt like a lumberjack. Fifth grader Christian Ilitich enjoyed Historic Mill Creek - &quot;It was really cool because we got to watch how a water-powered saw mill worked.&quot; Fourth grader Samantha Savage enjoyed observing the differences between Fort Michilimackinac and Fort Mackinac (the former is a reproduction and the latter is real, according to Samantha). Other favorites on the trip included shopping on Main Street on Mackinac Island (where fudge was apparently a favorite), walking around on their own at Fort Mackinac, and even spotting a ghost at the Grand Hotel!</p><p>Students in Mrs. Demartini's class are revisiting the presentations with their new knowledge and understanding. Said Wendy: &quot;What once was unknown is now known and we can look at each site with fresh eyes and revisit and reinforce what we learned.&quot;</p><p>Highlights from the teachers' perspective included the Grand Hotel, the carriage ride on Mackinac Island, spending time with the children and observing how kind they were to one another, and the following quote: &quot;I accidentally ate the fudge I bought for my mother!&quot;</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157626712248622/">Click here</a> to view pictures on Flickr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The contest between the two teams ended in a 7-7 tie, with the tie-breaker being number of goals scored against each team. The deferential was two goals (GPA goalkeepers Clay Brock and McCalla Mecke let up a total of 10 goals, while ASH let up 12).

We have had players at University of Detroit, De La Salle, Liggett and Grosse Pointe South. In fact, currently one third of the varsity players at South are from the Academy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hear ye! Hear ye! By order of the king, sixth graders ruled the school on Friday as they closed their study of the Middle Ages with the traditional sixth grade medieval feast. The event began with the grand entrance of Queen Harriet of GPA Manor escorted by King Michael of GPA Manor and Queen Amal of GPA Manor escorted by King Scott of GPA Manor. Students were divided into manor groups with a lord or lady as the head of the manor. They competed for farthings, and the manor with the most farthings was granted the head table. Those who sat below the salt were seated according to their rank.<br /><br />King Fultz greeted the guests as they entered the &ldquo;manor on the lake&rdquo; &ndash; the Academy&rsquo;s Lakeshore building &ndash; then conducted a knighting ceremony. The students played the roles of knights, monks, priests, lords and ladies of the land, and pages. They also provided entertainment as jugglers, jesters, dancers, magicians and musicians. Several &ldquo;serving wenches&rdquo; (i.e., mothers of the sixth graders dressed in costume) prepared and served the food. After each course was announced, two food tasters sampled the food to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t poisoned. Judgments were announced for evil deeds, with the priest begging for mercy for the evildoer. The folks in the gallery decided whether that person should be freed or sent to the dungeon. <br /><br />Contributing to the ambiance of the banquet were family crests and banners that the students created.</p><p>Go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157626804644762/">Flickr</a> to view pictures.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

Students took the test that was appropriate for the French curriculum in which they are enrolled. Their scores were then ranked against students locally as well as nationally who are enrolled in similar curricula.</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110628130444.jpg" /></center><p>Competing against middle school and high school students, the following Academy middle school students placed in the top 10 ranks both in the Metro Detroit Chapter and nationally: eighth grader and silver medal winner James Scott (#3 national ranking and #1 local ranking), eighth grader and bronze medal winner Nikolas Minanov (#5 national ranking and #2 local ranking), seventh grader and bronze medal winner Alexander Minanov (#6 national ranking and #1 local ranking), seventh grader and bronze medal winner Leonie Leslie (#7 national ranking and #2 local ranking), and sixth graders, who were ranked only at the national level: Katie Fruenhauf (#2 - silver medal winner); Stephanie Vermet (#3 - silver medal winner); Emma Andreasen, Antonina Cinnamond and Therese Drettmann (#4 and bronze medal winners); and Markus Minanov (#5 and bronze medal winner).<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GPA launched its &quot;Stand Up, Speak Out!&quot; (S.U.S.O.) Character Development Program on Thursday afternoon. This program is a follow-up to the school-wide Character Education Program that incorporated the following six pillars of character: respect, responsibility, caring, fairness, trustworthiness and citizenship.</p><p><img border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110909154731.jpg" />&quot;The goal of the Character Education Committee this year is to take our Character Education Program a step further by helping our students develop and utilize specific social skills and awarenesses,&quot; explained learning resources specialist Cheryl Blau, who serves on the Character Education Committee along with Interim Head of School Mike Kennedy, Grade 4-8 Principal Scott Tily, Early and Lower School Principal Jen Kendall, School Counselor Sean Hogan-Downey, and community service coordinator Sasha Murphy.</p><p>Individual classroom teachers ran activities within their own classrooms in grades 1-5 beginning at 1:20. Students in these classrooms engaged in a circle ball-toss activity that led students to discover and develop important communication, problem-solving, and team-building skills. Said Cheryl: &quot;Discussions of 'inside' feelings, 'outside' feelings, and what we each need to feel safe and comfortable so we can do our best learning followed, culminating with each student writing what he or she most needs on a leaf and adding it to our school tree on the front office wall.&quot;</p><p><img border="0" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20110909154754.jpg" />Middle school teachers ran an introductory slide show in the Tracy Fieldhouse, then students and teachers broke up into their homerooms for discussions of what they felt they each needed to make this an &quot;awesome&quot; year. This was followed by grade-level team-building/problem solving/communication skills activities in the field house. Sixth graders concluded the activities in the field house by participating in a unique game of kickball that helped them explore and develop their communication, problem-solving, and team-building skills.</p><p>The idea for the S.U.S.O. program came out of research that the Character Education Committee conducted to help GPA students develop and utilize specific social skills and awareness including assertiveness training, conflict resolution, defining and handling &quot;normal conflict,&quot; defining and handling &quot;harassment,&quot; defining and handling &quot;bullying,&quot; understanding the bully/victim/bystander triangle and roles, tattling vs. reporting, and anger management. The afternoon's activities represented a kick-off of the program and will be followed up by individual classroom lessons at each grade level.</p><p>To see photos from the afternoon, go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157627630678140/">Flickr</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourth and fifth graders presented their studies and interpretations of the work of British artist and naturalist Andy Goldsworthy on November 15 under the direction of Creative Arts Movement teacher Denise Szykula. Each student participated in displaying small group studies and class choreographies representing the unique nature of the artist's work. The students amplified their understanding of Goldsworthy in art class with Rosi Triano. Bringing in objects found in nature, they created their own naturalist art, capturing the ephemeral quality so inherent in Goldsworthy's artistic philosophy. &quot;I don't seek to mimic nature but to draw energy from it,&quot; said Goldsworthy. &quot;Movement, change, light, growth and decay are the lifeblood of nature, the energies that I try to tap through my work.&quot;</p><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20111121134616.jpg" /></center><p>Pictures of the Creative Arts Movement presentation are available on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157628038447573/">Flickr</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of their study on Michigan, fourth graders in Mr. Clor's social studies class have been researching and discussing the arrival of Europeans in Michigan. Before Christmas break, they were given a challenging assignment: to make a large, three-dimensional representation of an artifact important to this time period.</p><p>The students were asked to consider the following questions when deciding what to build: What might have the first French missionaries needed to survive the wilderness? Did French voyagers need tools to make a living? What might one find in an early British settlement? What transportation did all of these travelers use and in what types of buildings did they live?</p><p>Mr. Clor instructed the students that the &quot;sky is the limit for what materials you may use.&quot; His only stipulation was that artifacts should be large enough to display in class but small enough to fit through the doorway. They also needed to include a written paragraph describing the artifact and its importance to Michigan's history.</p><center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20120106131005.jpg" /></center></center><p>Pictured is a cannon created by Ryan Murphy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fourth grade headed to Lansing on Friday, January 27&nbsp;as part of their study of the government in social studies class. The students had the opportunity to visit with Michigan State Supreme Court Justice Robert Young, a former Academy parent, and even sit in the Justices' chairs! Then they headed to the Capitol building for a tour.</p><p>&quot;The highlight was probably lying on the glass floor and looking up at the awesome ceiling in the dome,&quot; said fourth grade teacher Didi DeBoer. Following their tour of the Capitol building, the students and teachers enjoyed a delicious lunch and then were off to the Historical Museum for another informative tour.</p><p align="center"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20120202143049.jpg" /></p><center></center><center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20120202143100.jpg" /></center><center></center><center></center><center><center><img border="0" alt="" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/uploaded_pics/cmsimages/image-20120202143113.jpg" /></center></center></center>]]></content:encoded>

In art class with Mrs. Baudeloque, they created their sea creatures as three-dimensional puppets using fluorescent paints. In French class with Madame Leslie, they listened to the story, &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; and learned the vocabulary for the most common animals that live in the ocean and created a book that displays all of the creatures that they studied. They then learned to express sentences with their newly developed vocabulary.</p><p>Music teacher Mrs. Chuhran selected &ldquo;The Aquarium&rdquo; from French composer Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns to accompany the students' presentation. The students learned all about this French composer&rsquo;s life and his amazing abilities.</p><p>All the pieces of this cross-curricular study came together on Friday morning when the first graders stood on stage in the Tracy Fieldhouse&nbsp;to introduce themselves and their sea creatures in French, and then all the sea creatures &quot;swam&quot; together under black light. The overall effect was colorful and magical.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recognition of its &ldquo;Green School&rdquo;&#8200;status, the Academy once again expanded Earth Day on Monday, April 23 to a week-long celebration. During the kick-off on Monday, each student and faculty member received an Earth Week sticker, and librarian Jane Baetens began the &ldquo;GPA&#8200;Green Reads&rdquo;&#8200;program during library class. First graders were given an Earth Week packet to work on throughout the week and each morning&rsquo;s bulletin included a &quot;green&quot; riddle of the day. (Example:&#8200;How did&nbsp; Benjamin Franklin feel when he discovered electricity? He was shocked!) A highlight for grades 1-3 was a special morning visit from the Arts and Scraps truck.<br /><br />Tuesday was bike, walk or carpool to school day. Mrs. Baetens continued the &ldquo;GPA Green Reads&rdquo;&#8200;program in library classes, and first through eighth graders figured out their carbon footprints in science class.<br /><br />On Waste Free Wednesday, first through eighth grade students and faculty weighed any waste left over from lunch. Sixth graders paid their weekly visits to classrooms and school offices to empty paper recycle bins.<br /><br />There was no school on Thursday due to parent/teacher conferences, but on Friday the seventh grade led an all-school paper drive, greeting parents at their cars and collecting their paper goods for recycling.<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

One tour guide even said that the Academy group was the most prepared group she had ever had. Says fifth grade teacher Trevor Clor, she &quot;claimed we were more knowledgeable than her eighth grade groups, specifically the one she had last week from Saginaw.&quot;</span><br style="WIDOWS: 2; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; FONT: 13px arial, sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; COLOR: rgb(34,34,34); WORD-SPACING: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px" /><br style="WIDOWS: 2; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; FONT: 13px arial, sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; LETTER-SPACING: normal; COLOR: rgb(34,34,34); WORD-SPACING: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px" /><span style="WIDOWS: 2; TEXT-TRANSFORM: none; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; DISPLAY: inline !important; FONT: 13px arial, sans-serif; WHITE-SPACE: normal; ORPHANS: 2; FLOAT: none; LETTER-SPACING: normal; COLOR: rgb(34,34,34); WORD-SPACING: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px">The first day the group walked the National Mall in a light drizzle, which was actually perfect weather, recalls Trevor, to view the sobering Vietnam, Korean, and World War II memorials.&nbsp;The second day students and teachers were up bright and early to make their appointment at Ford's Theater, where a&nbsp;park ranger provided an overview of the site and the history of the building.&nbsp;They also visited the White House and Capitol Building.<br /><br />Says Trevor: &quot;A highlight for the students was our trip to the National Zoo. The kids absolutely lost their minds at the site of the Panda Bears.&nbsp;It was hilarious.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year's Scholastic Book Fair, under the direction of co-chairs Heather Brundage and Kelley Smith, enjoyed sales of approximately $16,000 due to the generosity of our many parents, grandparents and special guests. Of this revenue, the school earned approximately $3,000 and increased sales by over 5% - a&nbsp;significant enough accomplishment that Scholastic awarded The Grosse Pointe Academy a sales growth bonus of $661.&nbsp;Also, thanks to the One for One Books program, in which Scholastic donated one book for every dollar that a&nbsp;student donated to the Book Fair,&nbsp;Scholastic will donate 750 books to a charity.&nbsp;Due to the program, the school also received an allowance of $750 for librarian Jane Baetens to purchase new books for the library, resulting in 45 new hard cover, high quality books for our students to enjoy in the years to come.</p><p>Volunteers came out in droves to help the hard-working co-chairs. &quot;From set-up to tear-down and everything in between, we couldn't have done it without them!&quot; said Heather. Many volunteers were present on multiple days. Thanks go to Alison Arkison, Debbie Bagby, Dorota Bamford, Michelle Becker, Karrie Bixler, Jen Bojarczyk, Elizabeth Bonev, Randi Brink, Mary Cantin, Carol Cinnamond, Nancy Cotton, Hagi Craig, Molly Donaldson, Jen Fauster, Jenny Fruehauf, Melissa Gray, Laura Gupte, Liz Homsy, Kim Kendrick, Yvette Korte, Amy Koskinen, Vesna Larrea, Wendy Maltby, Mary Alice Mecke, Carrie Paolucci, Susie Rahaim, Angela Randazzo, Julie Sheeren, Anita Valente, Celia Wade, Kelly Walsh and Karla Wortman. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During the presentation, the students displayed the three-dimensional sea creatures they had made in art class with Mrs. Baudeloque. They introduced themselves and their creatures in French using the vocabulary they learned in class with Mme Leslie, then created an underwater effect with the creatures &ldquo;swimming&rdquo; under black light to the music of &ldquo;The Aquarium,&rdquo; by French composer Camille Saint Saens. The children had learned about this composer in music class with Mrs. Chuhran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Tracy Fieldhouse will be transformed over the weekend and early next week as final preparations are underway for this year's annual Action Auction, which takes place on Wednesday, May 8 and Saturday, May 11.</p><p>Working with the theme &quot;All the Places You'll Go!&quot; - a take-off on the Dr. Seuss book of similar name - Auction chairs Michelle and Chuck Becker and Sandra and Peter Cavataio have built a wonderful catalog of items for the Auction. This theme not only represents the wide range of opportunities available to Academy students while at the school and throughout their journey to adulthood, but also the fantastic places you can go from the Auction.</p><p>Fabulous trips are really the center point of this year&rsquo;s offerings. All the places you will go include Paris, Hawaii, Bay Harbor, Orlando, Mackinac Island, Nashville, Germany and more. Although, with hundreds of items up for bidding, such as parties, home accessories, toys, student projects, and cultural and sporting event tickets, there is a wide variety of items available each night of the event to appeal to many tastes, interests, and budgets.</p><p>The paddle raising during the Live Auction will raise funds to support student innovation programs. The creation of an innovation and design center will focus on developing students&rsquo; interest and excitement in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). These programs will extend our current classroom experience to encourage new discovery and creativity</p><p>Back by popular demand, Neiman Marcus Club Action Auction will round out the evening on Saturday with a night-club atmosphere right in the Fieldhouse. Guests will dance the night away with music from DJ Prevu and world percussionist Jared Sykes.</p><p>All of the Academy and Metro Detroit community is invited to join us for Action Auction 2013 to help us support The Grosse Pointe Academy.

On Thursday, the students simulated the life of a monk during Monk Day, spending half the day in the Lakeshore Boardroom and the Chapel. Activities included taking a vow of silence, praying, and illuminating the manuscript of poetry they had written in language arts class. During the second half of the school day,&nbsp;students recited their poetry manuscripts during a Poetry Cafe held in the lower gym.<br /><br />On Friday, the class hosted the annual Medieval Banquet in the Lakeshore Parlor decorated with family crests and other artwork. The grand entrance of the royal court and guests was followed up with a knighthood ceremony, judgments, and a variety of entertainment. Between events parent volunteers served courses of bread and soup; chicken, roast potatoes, corn and baby carrots; and a final course of dessert. Entertainers included musicians, dancers, jesters, comedians, magicians and a dream-minstrel.<br /><br />A visiting delegation from China enlightened attendees with stories and myths from their faraway land while the French delegation delighted guests with a dance and song titled <em>Jean Petit</em>. The banquet concluded with a performance by the royal dance troupe.<br /><br />Click to see pictures of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157633503582837/">Monk Day</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157633503573399/">Medieval Banquet</a>.]]></content:encoded>

She has been selected by Challenge Detroit, a leadership and professional program, as one of 33 Fellows invited to live, work, play and give in and around the greater Detroit area for one year. Sarah was hired by Edw. C. Levy Co., a conglomerate whose focus is to help preserve our world through an advanced practice of environmental stewardship, recycling materials, employee safety, and customer satisfaction.</p><p>In addition to being hired by one of the participating companies, each Challenge Detroit Fellow has the opportunity to participate in monthly team challenges designed to positively impact the city and region. In addition, each Friday participants work in teams organized to generate innovative and impactful solutions to pressing needs faced by partner non-profit organizations.</p><p>Over 700 applications from across the country were narrowed down to 70 finalists. Finalists attended a two-day event to interview with the companies, participate in a mini team challenge, and experience the city.</p><p>Sarah said she applied for Challenge Detroit because she knew throughout her college years that she wanted to become a part of the efforts that are currently creating a momentum towards a better future for Detroit. She also felt that the program would help her discover the best way for her to understand and give back to the communities within the city that have endured.</p><p>&ldquo;My favorite part about applying for Challenge Detroit was the final interview process,&rdquo;&#8200;Sarah said. &ldquo;The energy and enthusiasm among all of the people present was contagious. I met many motivational and exciting people in those two days whom I look forward to working with and sharing our excitement about the city. There was an undeniable positive energy among everyone that left us all excited to call Detroit our home.&rdquo;</p><p>Sarah graduated from the College of Charleston in the spring of 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies with a concentration in Urban Planning. She was a 2013 Scholar, School of the Humanities and Social Science, 2013 Outstanding Minor, School of Business, and three-time recipient of a Scholar Athlete Award. As captain of the College of Charleston Sailing Team, she was a Finalist for the J. Stuart Walker Trophy for outstanding athletic, academic and leadership achievements in both 2012 and 2013 and was the 2011 Sailing MVP.</p><p>A 2009 graduate of&#8200;Grosse Pointe South, where she was a member of the cross country team for two years and the sailing team for four years as well as team captain, Sarah attributes much of her academic and athletic success to the foundation she received at The Grosse Pointe Academy.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the greatest things the Academy did for me was rebuild my confidence and enhance my learning skills,&rdquo; Sarah said. &ldquo;After I struggled for my first three years of grade school, my parents transferred me for fourth grade to the Academy, where they knew I would be given the extra care and help I needed to improve. Through tutoring and extra guidance I strengthened my academic abilities. Not only did the Academy offer me the opportunity to catch up and excel, but my teachers were incredibly supportive and instrumental in reviving my confidence and skills.&rdquo;</p><p>Sarah&rsquo;s involvement in Academy athletics contributed to her later successes in high school and college and played a major role in developing her team bonding and leadership skills as well as goal-oriented drive for success.</p><p>&ldquo;I participated in every sport available at the Academy and over the years it has helped me better communicate with my peers as well as create a well-rounded understanding of teamwork, dedication, time management, organizational skills and leadership.&rdquo;</p><p>These are all skills that Sarah is sure to apply to her work at Edward C. Levy Co. and her year-long contributions to Challenge Detroit. As for her future beyond the Fellowship, Sarah envisions continuing to live downtown and work in the city.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to be more involved in urban development and planning as well as to volunteer within the communities,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&#8200;I grew up loving Detroit and now I&rsquo;d like to call it my home.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&rsquo;s theme of The Grosse Pointe Academy Action Auction &ndash; All the Places You&rsquo;ll Go! &ndash; inspired a whimsical, colorful atmosphere for the two nights. During Wednesday night&rsquo;s silent auction and preview, guests dined on sumptuous selections from strolling food stations while bidding on items on cell phones or other portable devices using the Clickbid system.</p><p>Saturday night featured silent and super silent auctions, a seated dinner catered by Plum Market and the much anticipated live auction. The center point of Saturday&rsquo;s live offerings were fabulous trips. Guests had an array of choices of places to go, including Paris, Hawaii, Bay Harbor, Orlando, Nashville, Germany and more.&nbsp; The Country Music Awards, Oktoberfest, Masters Golf Tournament 2014 were just a few of the fabulous destinations offered.</p><p>Another highlight of the live auction was the paddle-raising for the Academy&rsquo;s Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Plan. The creation of an innovation and design center will focus on developing students&rsquo; interest and excitement in the fields of STEM. Support for this initiative was outstanding.&nbsp; Parents, grandparents, past parents and friends raised their paddles to the amount of $145,000! This effort, combined with last year&rsquo;s paddle-raising for technology, raised nearly half a million dollars for the school, demonstrating a remarkable outpouring of community support. </p><p>Saturday night&rsquo;s festivities ended with a reprise of Neiman Marcus Club Action Auction, which provided a night-club atmosphere right in the Tracy Fieldhouse. Guests danced the night away with music from DJ Prevu and world percussionist Jared Sykes. Special thanks go to Neiman Marcus for hosting and staging this remarkable after party.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157633599842415/">Click here</a> to see pictures on Flickr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The following eighth graders received bronze medals: Stephanie Vermet (#4 national ranking and #2 local ranking), Therese Drettmann (#5 ranking both nationally and locally), Markus Minanov (#5 ranking both nationally and locally), and Antonina Cinnamond (#6 ranking both nationally and locally).</p><p>Seventh grader Karina Minanov, who was ranked #1 in metro Detroit and 3rd nationally, received a silver medal.

Given six works of art to examine, they were to rank them for the following: which they would like to have in their own homes, which was most likely to sell for a lot of money, which took the longest to paint, which was most likely to win a prize, which was their favorite, and which they did not like at all. They then compared their total scores to the reality of the paintings, which challenged their perceptions of art. For example, the painting the students liked least won England's Turner prize; and a work of art by Willem de Kooning the students thought looked like a scribble was the third highest selling artwork at auction.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

As we recognize what is happening, we can better the learning environment and social relationships in education and the world. Making the world a better place to live is what it is all about.&rdquo;</span></p><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Dr. Rosen touched upon the importance of resting the mind, citing one way to do so by going outdoors and enjoying nature. Said Jeanette:</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&quot;It is reassuring to confirm that going outside and being surrounded by nature can calm and reset us to charge ahead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, December 13, Middle School students experienced their first taste of electives, which will meet once a month from now through the spring for a total of five sessions. Students chose from a variety of options, many of which will include visits out in the field for real world experiences.</p><p>In <strong>Application Design</strong> with Mr. Rochte, students designed and created their own application for use on tablets and smartphones. Students will learn programming and visit programmers in the field.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20131213170318.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br /><br /></center><p>Mrs. Hogle will take her students to a classical concert at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra as part of the&nbsp;<strong>Marketing Program Design</strong>&nbsp;elective. Students will create a marketing plan to develop a specific marketing program for classical music for the target audience of middle and high school students.</p><p>In <strong>CSI</strong> with Mrs. Jerome and Mrs. Roberts, students will learn crime scene analysis techniques. In the first session, for example, students learned about finger printing and examined their own fingerprints! Students will meet with a crime lab scientist and may even visit an active crime lab.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20131213170347.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />In M<strong>oot Court </strong>with Madame El-Hosni, Mrs. Kristan and Mrs. Whitaker, students will learn the art of debate, rules of presenting arguments, rebuttal, problem-solving and impromptu response. They will debate their own issue and visit a courthouse.</p><p>Leadership is the focus of two electives. In <strong>Team Leadership in the 21st Century </strong>with Mr. Cowan, students will examine the varied elements of leadership, including qualities of leadership, listening, conflict management and risk taking. Students will create leadership opportunities for their peers and visit local government offices.</p><p>In <strong>Service Discovery</strong> with Mrs. Patton, students will research and visit local and national non-profit organizations in detail, ultimately selecting a community based organization and devising and implementing a community based service project.</p><p>Students may also explore their social conscience in<strong> Teach Green</strong> with Sasha Murphy. The students will research topics such as water pollution, air pollution and recycling in order to create and implement &quot;green&quot; lessons for the school. They will also visit a green company.</p><p>Mr. DeLuca began his <strong>Investigative Reporting/Video Production</strong> elective with a visit from M.L. Elrick, a Pulitzer Prize and Emmy Award winning investigative reporter with Fox 2 News. Mr. Elrick talked about the importance of reporting to create awareness and then effect a change. He distinguished investigative reporting from other news types not as &quot;negative news,&quot; but as a positive step in bringing awareness to an issue that needs to be resolved.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20131213170417.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />&quot;When I look for a story, I look for something that's broken,&quot; he said to the students. By reporting the story, he gives people &quot;the opportunity to make changes, to make improvements.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our job is simple,&quot; Mr. Elrick explained. &quot;We ask questions, we get answers, and then we let you guys decide.&quot;<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;"><br /></span></p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157638646557354/">Click here</a> to view more pictures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The informative night on Thursday, January 16 featured a variety of student presentations.</span></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140117171358.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br /><span style="font-size: 14px;">Middle school students demonstrated to parents features of technology that have been particularly beneficial to them, resulting in a personalized approach to instruction, increased engagement, integration of subjects across a variety of disciplines, and ease of collaboration through Google docs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">For example, according to one student, use of the program Wordly Wise makes learning vocabulary and diagramming grammar &quot;fun&quot;. Google docs allows students to share documents, and other apps help with organization and note-taking. A presentation for language arts class on <em>The Outsiders</em> using Pic Collage showed how students incorporate creativity into their presentations. In addition, completing the sixth grade leaf project on the iPad allowed the students to collect more than just leaves as they included pictures of the bark as well as the entire tree itself, serving as a much more effective reference guide.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Other highlights included sixth grade students showing their interactive biology ebook, Josh Roberts and Brandon Murphy &quot;demo-ing&quot; the apps they created in Mr. Rochte's elective, and Samantha Savage demonstrating examples from her Educreations App where she made a video with her voice-over explaining various grammar rules.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Discussion ensued on the &quot;flipped classroom&quot; in mathematics classes, with some students mentioning use of the Khan Academy's on-line classes and others discussing math teacher Wendy Jerome's pre-recorded video lectures.&nbsp;Students observed that the &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; approach allowed them to watch lectures at home, then practice at school, versus the traditional approach of hearing lectures at school and practicing (i.e., doing homework) at home without the benefit of the teacher's presence when encountering obstacles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Said Lars Kuelling about this innovative approach: &quot;This is a bit like an NFL quarterback watching game film and studying that week's offensive playbook, then coming to practice ready to play.&nbsp;Now the teacher gets to coach the student in real time, and students can only benefit from the personalized practice.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The use of iPads has also been beneficial as an assessment tool with the use of the &quot;Socratic Classroom&quot; app, allowing teachers to engage every student, assess his or her understanding, and give immediate feedback.&nbsp;Mike Cowan, Social Studies and English faculty member, described his joy at seeing every student in the class engaged in learning and praised the approach for allowing him to solicit an answer from each student in class, not just those industrious students who are quick to raise a hand in response to a question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Special thanks go to middle school students (pictured above from left): Josh Roberts, Brandon Murphy, Maria Fields, Samantha Savage, Hannah Lemanski, and Tate Kuelling for their participation, and to Megan Black, Mike Cowan, and Lawrence DeLuca for leading the presentation.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

YES. A study reported in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news-impact/2012/09/do-middle-schools-make-sense/">Ed: The Magazine of the Harvard Graduate School of Education</a>&nbsp;makes a convincing argument for the benefits of a K-8 school versus a stand-alone middle school. Their research found that students who left elementary schools for middle schools in grades 6 or 7 &quot;lose ground in both reading and math compared to their peers who attend K-8 schools.&quot;</span></p><p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Clinical psychologist and author Michael Thompson supports this study in his book&nbsp;<em>Best Friends, Worst Enemies: Understanding the Social Lives of Children.</em>&nbsp;He states: &quot;If I could design psychologically safe schools, every elementary school in America would go from K-grade 8 and would be no larger than 400 children.&quot;</span></p><p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">GPA's middle school principal Lawrence DeLuca is in full agreement. &quot;A K-8 environment provides many advantages beyond improving academic performance. Students experience fewer transitions, they develop long-term relationships with teachers and other students, and there is an opportunity for cross-age tutoring and role modeling under one roof. For example, our buddy program helps the first graders feel comfortable in their new environment while giving the eighth graders the opportunity to act as leaders and role models.&quot;</span></p><p style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/12.html">Click here</a>&nbsp;to find out more about the Academy's middle school.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Each student selected a sea creature to research and prepare a written report.

They&nbsp;introduced themselves and their creatures in French using the vocabulary they learned in class with Mme Leslie, then created an underwater effect with the creatures &quot;swimming&quot; under black light to the music of &quot;The Aquarium,&quot; by French composer Camille Saint Saens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When eighth grader Grace Andreasen went to the 2014 Southeastern Michigan Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards Ceremony on Wednesday, February 12, she did not expect to run into her big buddy from GPA. Four years ago, when Grace Andreasen was in fourth grade, she was matched up with Carmella Goree '11 as her seventh grade buddy. The two reunited at the Detroit Film Theater at the DIA, where they each received Scholastic Art awards.&nbsp;Grace received an Honorable Mention in Printmaking, and Carmella received a Gold Key in Photography.</p><p>Receiving a Silver Key in Printmaking was eighth grader Hannah Lemanski. Hannah's Quilt Reduction Print was featured in GPA's art show invitation. The art show is scheduled for Tuesday, March 4 from 3:30 to 8:00 p.m.</p><center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140214121954.png" border="0" alt="" /></center></center><p><br />Also receiving awards were former GPA art students and alumni Kate Krueger '10 and Kate Van Pelt '10. Kate Krueger received an Honorable Mention in Painting and Kate Van Pelt received a Gold Key in Digital Art. One of Kate Van Pelt's pieces featured a gingko leaf - of particular interest to anyone who remembers the sixth grade leaf project!</p><p><em>Hannah and Grace are pictured above with their art teacher, Holly Kristan.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to GPA had to lace up their gym shoes and put on their thinking caps for this year's Parents'/Special Friends' Day for grades 1-5. First through fourth graders put their guests to the test with games in honor of the 2014 Olympics such as Build the Torch, Snowball Toss, Super G, Olympic Sculpting, Icy Dicey and Curling. (Examples: In Icy Dicey, contestants put a tongue depressor in their mouths, stacked three die on top, and timed how long they could keep it balanced. In Super G, participants balanced a vanilla wafer on their forehead and tried to get it in their mouth without using their hands!) They also took a Socrative Quiz on Olympics trivia using their iPads.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140228162650.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />Mrs. Stepanek's third graders built race cars and competed to see whose car could go the farthest. They also played chess and students demonstrated different apps they are using on their iPads. Fifth graders played trivia games in the classroom and then challenged their guests to dodgeball, badminton and basketball in the Tracy Fieldhouse.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157641656047133/">Click here</a>&nbsp;to view pictures from the morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Middle School electives continue to bring real world experience and applied learning to sixth, seventh and eighth graders at The Grosse Pointe Academy. On Friday students attended their third session of electives.</p><p>In Mr. Cowan's team leadership elective, Grosse Pointe Farms Mayor Jim Farquar spoke about the role of the mayor and city council.</p><p>In Sasha Murphy's Teach Green Time elective, students taught the second graders different ways to be more energy efficient. The second graders were divided into two groups. They learned how to make a garden out of used plastic bottles, they listed ways they can be less wasteful, read a story about the life of a plastic bottle, and played a memory card game with pictures of animals.</p><p>In CSI with Mrs. Jerome and Mrs. Roberts, students prepared for their DNA analysis on the new electrophoresis machine by learning how to pipette, and in Application Design with Mr. Rochte, students continued work on creating their own computer apps. For example, eighth grader Brad Bixler created an app for the computer called Unique Turtle, which is programmed to create unique designs (see example below).</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140228161142.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />Students in the moot court elective were fortunate to have two parents lawyers visit. Mrs. Fields (mother of Maria, grade 6) and Mrs. Johnson (mother of Alex, grade 8) listened, guided and helped students prepare their arguments on oppositing sides of the debate.</p><p>Said Amal El-Hosni: &quot;The students were excited to have real life professionals in the field share their time and expertise with the group.&quot; Next month, the moot court team will visit an appellate court in downtown Detroit and have a chance to meet and talk with Judge Murray in his chambers.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157641664778925/">Click here</a> to view pictures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Every nook and cranny and alcove of the third floor Valade Art Loft &amp; Gallery was filled with wall-to-wall artwork during the annual K-8 Student Art Show. Special thanks go to art teachers Kate Baudeloque (K-3) and Holly Kristan (grades 4-8) for giving their students a creative outlet all year. The results on display were outstanding! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157641911332675/">Click here</a> for pictures.</p><p>Science teacher Wendy Jerome and the seventh graders hosted the first Robotics Fair on that same night. Boards on display showed the history of robotics, and students demonstrated for parents how they programmed their iPads to control robots in a game of Robot Soccer. The parents even joined in the competition! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc3MFdZlAu8&amp;list=UUKNKqGa989aq4zmd_yaLWVw&amp;feature=c4-overview">Click here</a> to view a video.</p><p>High school aged GPA alumni got together in the Tracy Fieldhouse to shoot hoops and catch up with former classmates and teachers. Many were also able to stop by the art show or the robotics fair or visit teachers in their classrooms. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157641911536475/">Click here</a> for pictures.</p><p>All in all, it was a great night for GPA, and a great way for our visitors for the Admissions Open House to see the school in action!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month's R.E.A.L. (Real-World Experiences and Applied Learning) classes for middle school students got the students and teachers out of their classrooms and into the field for real life exposure to their chosen areas of interest.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140404165934.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />In Investigative Reporting and Video Production, Mr. DeLuca and his students visited WDIV Channel 4, where executive producer and GPA graduate Tim French gave them a tour of the Newsroom, Studio, Control Room and Master Control. One of the highlights was meeting Emmy award winning meteorologist Andrew Humphrey,<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;who explained how he produces his weather reports and spoke with the students about the importance of finding a career about which you are passionate.</span></p><center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140410152058.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></center><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br />The Moot Court R.E.A.L class travelled with Madame El-Hosni, Mrs. Kristan and Mrs. Whitaker to the District I location of the Michigan Court of Appeals and met with Judge Christopher Murray, husband of GPA third grade teacher Bridgette Murray. Judge Murray discussed how the Court of Appeals functions, accompanied the students to view the Court of Appeals in session, and graciously answered student questions. The students especially enjoyed hearing live arguments regarding two criminal cases and one civil case. Said Holly Kristan about the experience:</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&quot;</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif;">This was quite a privilege for our students, and we sincerely thank Judge Murray for this wonderful opportunity.&quot;</span></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140404172523.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />Mrs. Patton's Service Discovery group, along with GPA fourth graders, packed 300 food bags for children at Gleaner's.</p><p>Back at GPA, the Teach Green group built a hamster house, submarine, Frisbee, &nbsp;cars and ships out of recycled items., Mr. Cowan's Leadership team, having already enjoyed a visit from a military leader and a government leader, learned about unconventional leaders, and students in Mr. Rochte's Application Design continued to design apps for use on tablets and smartphones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After school on Wednesday afternoon, teachers led or attended a series of mini-clinics on technology.

Research shows that class size is an important determinant of student outcomes.</p><p>In fact, a study released in 2014 and published by the University of Colorado Boulder noted that just a few years ago the average United States class size for public primary school teachers in self-contained classes was 21.6 and that the &ldquo;evidence suggests that increasing class size will harm not only children&rsquo;s test scores in the short run but also their long-term human capital formation.&rdquo;</p><p>An article first published in The Washington Post and available below summarized and discussed the findings of this research from UCB's National Education Policy Center.</p><p>The actual study, published as a policy brief, is <strong><a href="http://greatlakescenter.org/docs/Policy_Briefs/Schanzenbach_ClassSize.pdf" target="_blank">available here in its entirety</a></strong>.</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong>&nbsp;or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146. E-mail: mmcdermott@gpacademy.org.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>Class size matters a lot, research shows</strong></p><p><em>By Valerie Strauss, The Washington Post&nbsp;</em></p><p>Every now and then someone in education policy (Arne Duncan) or education philanthropy (Bill Gates) or the media (Malcolm Gladwell) will say something about why class size isn&rsquo;t really very important because a great teacher can handle a boatload of kids.</p><p>Not really.</p><p>A review of the major research that has been conducted on class size by Northwestern University Associate Professor Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach and published by the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado Boulder makes clear that class size matters, and it matters a lot. Schanzanbach, an associate professor of human development and social policy at Northwestern and chair of the Institute for Policy Research&rsquo;s Program on Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies, writes in the review:</p><p>Considering the body of research as a whole, the following policy recommendations emerge:</p><p>&bull; Class size is an important determinant of student outcomes, and one that can be directly determined by policy. All else being equal, increasing class sizes will harm student outcomes.</p><p>&bull; The evidence suggests that increasing class size will harm not only children&rsquo;s test scores in the short run, but also their long-run human capital formation. Money saved today by increasing class sizes will result in more substantial social and educational costs in the future.</p><p>&bull; The payoff from class-size reduction is greater for low-income and minority children, while any increases in class size will likely be most harmful to these populations.</p><p>&bull; Policymakers should carefully weigh the efficacy of class-size policy against other potential uses of funds. While lower class size has a demonstrable cost, it may prove the more cost-effective policy overall.</p><p>Why do small classes work? She writes:</p><p>The mechanisms at work linking small classes to higher achievement include a mixture of higher levels of student engagement, increased time on task, and the opportunity small classes provide for high-quality teachers to better tailor their instruction to the students in the class.</p><p>The research is there. Class size matters. Even the finest teachers are limited in what they can do when they have large classes.</p><p>So can we stop pretending that class size doesn&rsquo;t matter?</p><p><em>Valerie Strauss covers education for The Washington Post and runs The Answer Sheet blog.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

Epiphany is a non-profit organization that serves students and families on Detroit's east side with individualized learning support. Last year they received a grant for 25 iPads. Several tutors visited GPA on Thursday to visit classrooms and see effective iPad integration in action. Teachers shared best apps and practices on how to effectively utilize the iPads to practice skills, support reading comprehension, and demonstrate understanding. Assisted by our Technology and Learning Specialist, Megan Black, the tutors from the Epiphany Center came away with new ideas for their work with low income students.&nbsp;Even the eighth graders got in on the action, sharing their own newly learned skills with the tutors.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140516163037.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157644288108377/"><br />Click here</a>&nbsp;for more pictures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Each class designed a garden to complement their curriculum and if these gardens haven&rsquo;t already been established, they will be sown in the remaining days of school. Before the Early School departs for summer, Peggy Varty&rsquo;s class will install their spectacular sundial and beautiful bird house hand made by the five and under apprentice carpenters.</span></span></p><p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span id="docs-internal-guid-25bde891-4df8-5afd-9b50-4bc00b1f0e4f"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Didi DeBoer and Megan Black have been named Co-Coordinators of the STEM/STEAM initiative and Garden Classroom.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 24px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(20, 24, 35);">&quot;It's like going on a treasure hunt!&quot; &quot;There are a gazillion beans here!&quot; &quot;This is so much fun!&quot; &quot;I can't believe how tall our sunflowers are!&quot;</span></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140804154235.png" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial;color:#141823"><br />These were a few of the comments from children who participated in GPA's first Garden Day on Monday, August 4. Students and parents enjoyed picking vegetables, weeding, deadheading flowers, staking tomatoes and cucumbers, watering, fertilizing, eating popsicles, and more. The vegetables picked were tomatoes, cucumbers, basil, green beans, green peppers, hot peppers, zucchini, and summer squash.<br /><br />This innovative programming, an outgrowth of GPA's STEM program, ties to the school's roots as a self-sustaining farm back in its Academy of the Sacred Heart days.<br /><br />The carefully planned garden, which students and teachers refer to as a classroom in spite of its outdoor location, enjoys a bit of whimsy in its organization &ndash; a butterfly garden by the gazebo, a pizza lover&rsquo;s delight garden with several varieties of tomatoes and basil surrounded by marigolds, pumpkins and gourds planted by Early School children in The Great Pumpkin Patch &ndash; but there is meaning behind the playfulness. <br /><br />Each grade level, from the preschoolers and kindergarteners in the Montessori Early School to eighth graders in the middle school, is responsible for a garden plot, and each plot has its own unique theme. Many of the themes are related to that grade level&rsquo;s curriculum. For example, The Storybook Garden contains flowers one would find in several children&rsquo;s stories, such as snapdragons, zinnias, lamb&rsquo;s ear, and dahlias. Mr. McGregor and Peter Rabbit&rsquo;s Gardens, named after the popular Beatrix Potter storybook characters, contain produce that any rabbit would risk sneaking into the garden for, such as cucumber, zucchini, summer squash and peppers.<br /><br />The fourth grade created the &ldquo;What thyme is it?&rdquo; garden, which is a biorhythmic garden that features flowers that open in relation to the time of day or location of sun, such as morning glory, Mexican daisies, evening primrose, thyme, 4 o&rsquo;clock flowers and moonflowers, with stepping stones representing the hours of the day. George and Martha&rsquo;s Garden is the fifth grade&rsquo;s representation of their study of the U.S. Constitution. Finally, middle school students will be conducting experiments in Mendel&rsquo;s Hypothesis Garden, which includes pea plants, a nod to Mendel&rsquo;s famous benchmark genetic studies involving peas.<br /><br />Future plans for when school is back in session include a flower bed behind the gazebo where middle school students will study soil acidity and how hydrangeas react to various changes.<br /><br />&ldquo;The garden is a work in progress,&rdquo; said fourth grade teacher Didi DeBoer, who is garden coordinator along with Technology and Learning Specialist Megan Black. &ldquo;It has endless possibilities and we are looking forward to seeing what it yields for the coming year.&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:Arial;color:#141823"><br /><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157645769361870/">Click here</a> to view more pictures.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

Does it feel like there isn't enough structure and there is too much play time?&nbsp;Do you worry about the lack of personal attention your child receives? Is it all about cutesy songs like the Itsy Bitsy Spider? Or should you be looking for a preschool where your child is guided to discover, to explore, and to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for future success?<br /><br /><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140812093901.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="border: none; margin: 4px 0px 12px 24px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" />At The Grosse Pointe Academy Montessori Early School, students begin formal learning at an early age - as young as 2 1/2. The best learning at this ages comes from engaged teachers and a purposeful classroom environment. The Practical Life area, the Sensorial area, and the Academic areas - including reading, math, science, and geography - are all part of the carefully structured learning plan.</div><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</div><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140812093916.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="border: none; margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" /></p><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&quot;Our very youngest children are taught to make individual choices based on their abilities and interests, to take Montessori materials from the child height shelves, and to develop budding interests,&quot; said Jennifer Kendall, Director of the Academy's Early School Education. &quot;Teachers foster this process by assessing the children's readiness for a learning activity, demonstrating a skill, and guiding a child's work as necessary.&quot;</div><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</div><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Technology may have its place in learning, but at this early age, sensorial engagement with the pink tower, the thousand chain, the smelling jars, the sound boxes, bells, the geometric solids, and the sandpaper letters are more important for early childhood development. All of the senses are engaged in this total immersion in learning, with the tablet taking a back seat to the moveable alphabet - where 4 and 5 year olds, and even some 3 years olds, start to spell, to read, and to build numeracy skills.</div><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">&nbsp;</div><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140812094039.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="border: none; margin: 4px 0px 12px 24px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: right; background-color: transparent; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" /></p><div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">And there's more: GPA students learn French from age 3.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="border: none; margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left; background: transparent;" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140828180738.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">One needs to spend only a few minutes with second grade teacher Beth Ahee and fourth grade teacher Didi DeBoer to feel the positive energy between them. And no wonder - the two have known each other for 21 years, having met on the T-ball diamond when their sons played on the same team and their husbands were both coaches. They were part of a winning team then and they are part of a winning team now.</span></p><p>Beth and Didi have been appointed Lower School (grades 1-3) Team Leader and Intermediate (grades 4-5) Team Leader, respectively. In this new role, they will assist Lawrence DeLuca, the Assistant Head of School for Instruction, Grades 1-8 Principal, in analyzing curricula, programs and assessments with the Lower and Intermediate School teams. Beth and Didi will serve as positive role models and mentors to foster a high level of morale and to support, encourage and guide teachers.</p><p>The two have dedicated a good part of their summer to making sure they will hit the ground running at the start of the school year. They began the benchmarking process by looking at what other independent schools in the region and around the country are doing in all areas of the curriculum. They looked specifically for schools with forward thinking, hands on and exploratory programs, with an eye on programs that would enhance the Academy&rsquo;s science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) initiatives.</p><p>For example, as part of the science curriculum, work in the classrooms will be enhanced in the Innovation Design Center. Didi and Megan Black, STEAM Co-Coordinators, will work together to create exploration activities for the students to perform in the lab that will expand upon what teachers are teaching in class. The result will be project-based learning that is experiential and hands-on.</p><p>&ldquo;There is always that moment in class or the Innovation Design Center when that innovative child steps up and does something we as teachers would never have even thought of,&rdquo; said Didi. &ldquo;Then there is that child who hangs back, looking for more direction. We want every child to have the skills and tools they need so that they are comfortable and not afraid to try. At the same time we want them to do more than follow directions and spit something back, but to be critical thinkers and problem solvers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to reviewing the curriculum at each grade level, Beth and Didi will look at the yearly transitions in subject areas, ensuring that teachers build on students&rsquo; knowledge from grade to grade.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We want to make sure we&rsquo;re at the cutting edge as we transition from year to year,&rdquo; said Beth. &ldquo;The focus is on building on skills to make sure we are aligned rather than overlapping, and ensuring a smooth transition so that each student is receiving the best education possible.&rdquo;</p><p>The process of building over the years is beneficial not just to the students but to teachers as well. &ldquo;We will be looking at the big picture,&rdquo; said Beth. &ldquo;All the first through fifth grade teachers will see what we are trying to accomplish and how they are each part of the process.&rdquo; The goal in these first five years will be to ensure a seamless transition to middle school in which students will continue to build on the skills they have acquired in grades 1-5, preparing them for the next step, high school, and, ultimately, college.</p><p>Beth and Didi&rsquo;s new responsibilities as Team Leaders will be particularly beneficial to Lawrence DeLuca as he himself transitions into his expanded role as Principal for Grades 1-8.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very exited to work with both Didi and Beth,&rdquo; said Lawrence. &ldquo;They are master teachers and experts in their fields, as well as dynamic individuals who bring a great energy to their class.&rdquo; In a letter sent to parents over the summer he cited their ability to lead amongst their peers, knowledge of the curriculum, work ethic, love of teaching, and ability to work with families.</p><p>For Beth and Didi, it is all about teamwork. It is the synergy between the teachers at all grade levels and the spirit of innovation and collaboration that will make their new roles as Team Leaders most rewarding.</p><p>&quot;One of the best parts about working at the Academy is that all the teachers really get along,&rdquo; said Beth.</p><p>Echoed Didi: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a pleasure to work collaboratively with people who all share a vision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am confident that with Lawrence in his new position as Principal for Grades 1-8, and with Didi and Beth serving as Team Leaders, we have all the right elements in place for an extremely successful school year,&quot; said Head of School Lars Kuelling. &quot;I can't wait to get started.<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 150%; text-indent:

Having worked in education my entire adult life, I have witnessed the opening of many school years, and I never grow tired of it. That first day makes me think of the sound of the starter&rsquo;s gun in a road race&hellip;the nerves, the excitement, the readiness to get out and get started already after the months of meticulous preparation. Let&rsquo;s get going already!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The excitement is palpable as we greet students and parents each year, whether someone is returning to school and greeting a friend or teacher, or whether they are new to the school and meeting classmates and teachers for the first time. This was definitely the case during Tuesday&rsquo;s orientation sessions when I had the privilege of welcoming parents and students to the 2014-15 school year. I began each session with the same message, the same advice that I&rsquo;ve used as a classroom teacher, middle school principal, and now as a head of school.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">My message to students was to keep three things in mind to ensure a great school year. The first is to respect self, others, and property. Respect is key to everything we do here at The Grosse Pointe Academy.<o:p></o:p></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140904121653.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" style="border: none; margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left; background: transparent;" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Second is to be kind. Kindness goes a long way in life, and I encouraged students to seek out different ways to be kind, whether welcoming a new student, making space for someone at the lunch table, or inviting someone new to play at recess.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Third was to have fun &ndash; to do something new, to try something, and to make the most of what you have been given. Nobody likes to hang out with you if you have a big rain cloud trailing behind you, I told them. And the good news is that the teachers at GPA like to have fun too!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">My message to the parents was to remind them they have made the right choice by selecting The Grosse Pointe Academy. Over the summer I followed closely the national conversation about educational standards and what the state of Michigan plans to do with mandated testing, and what I have concluded is that those standards are about being average.<o:p></o:p></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140904121145.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" style="border: 0px;" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The sad reality is that too many teachers are having to focus on the one or two students who may make the difference between a 72 and 74% pass rate, rather than on&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;of the students. What about the students at the top end, who are not being pushed or challenged? What about the students who need a little extra attention so that they, too, can be successful?&nbsp;Or those who could be inspired to pursue a passion, if only teachers could focus on the joy of learning and what is best for kids?<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In my summer letter I referenced my friend Mick Gee, Head of School at Allendale Columbia School, who observed that independent schools such as ours are &ldquo;the cure for the Common Core.&rdquo; I really like Mick&rsquo;s idea, as I believe he has captured the heart of fine independent school education in his witticism, and I&rsquo;d make my own observation that we provide an&nbsp;<i>uncommon&nbsp;</i><i>education</i>&nbsp;for our students and that our parents have made an&nbsp;<i>uncommon choice</i>&nbsp;in a world of average educations.<o:p></o:p></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140904121043.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" style="border: 0px;" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">What makes us the uncommon choice, the better than average option for students? We focus on every student. We inspire students academically, in the arts, and athletically. We challenge them to learn and nurture them when they need a little extra care, and since we know each student so well, we endeavor to bring out the best in each student.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Perhaps most uniquely, we partner with parents, and we respond to parent insights. For example, two years ago during our ISACS survey, we asked parents what they would like to see in The Grosse Pointe Academy of the future. Parents responded that they would like to see problem solving, creativity, innovation, and real world applications. What you see today at GPA is quite different from what you may have seen two years ago, and a lot of that is because we responded to parents.<o:p></o:p></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140904121847.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" style="border: none; margin: 4px 24px 12px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline; float: left; background: transparent;" /></p><p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Today you see cutting-edge technology in every classroom, STEM activities in the Innovation &amp; Design Center, the integration of the arts across the curriculum as we take STEM to STEAM, the R.E.A.L. (Real-World Experiences and Applied Learning) electives program in the middle school, and a garden classroom. Our esteemed <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/156.html">McMillan Lecturer</a>, <a href="http://zhaolearning.com/">Yong Zhao</a>, who is visiting us in November, will speak to the difference entrepreneurship, creativity and problem solving can make in a child&rsquo;s educational experience.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">We are certainly proud of what we have accomplished, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have made any of these strides without parent input.&nbsp;As a parent at The Grosse Pointe Academy, you have made the uncommon choice.&nbsp;It is by partnering together that we are able to create the very best educational environment for each of our students, and we thank you for making the choice to join with us in providing a first-rate experience for each and every student.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, September 15, second and third graders celebrated International Dot Day. This celebration is based on a book by Peter Reynolds entitled <em>The Dot.</em> It began in 2009 and each year participants have grown globally. It is a story about a teacher who dares a doubting student to trust in her own abilities by being brave enough to &quot;make her mark.&quot; She begins with a small dot on a piece of paper that becomes a breakthrough in confidence and courage. Her creativity blooms and she encourages other to &quot;make thier mark.&quot; Basically, it's about embracing one's own creativity and inspiring creativity in others.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140919144004.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />The students made their mark by making a dot and signing their names. Said second grade teacher Beth Ahee: &quot;They were all quite curious as to what they were doing. We then read the story and discussed ways to 'make our mark.'&quot; In the afternoon, students made a dot that came to life with an iPad app called CoLar Mix. They also made a collaborative dot collage that will be hanging outside in the hallway and made dot paintings in art class with Mrs. Baudeloque. Said one student to Mrs. Baudeloque: &quot;This is dot-tastic!&quot;</p><p>They finished the day's festivities by enjoying &quot;dot&quot; pancakes.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140919144027.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />&quot;The children had a ball and hopefully took home an excellent message about trusting their abilities and creativity!&quot; said Mrs. Ahee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to STEAM co-coordinator Megan Black, The Grosse Pointe Academy is &quot;definitely on the Monarch migratory route. We had swarms of Monarch butterflies over the previous few days and classes at all levels enjoyed watching them on the butterfly bushes in the main school circle as well as the garden where they stopped by for some nectar.&quot; Mrs. Sturm's Early school classes took advantage of the moment to draw pictures.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140919144624.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><br />Also, the giant sunflowers that graced the garden have gone to seed. Said Megan:<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&quot;</span>We removed them from the stalks and donated them to each Montessori room so that they could tweeze the seeds out as a fine motor skill activity. The kids in the big school remembered fondly doing this so we had a few extra flowers and Mrs. DeBoer's science classes also began to harvest the seeds.&quot; Mrs. Sturm's class also draw the sunflowers.&nbsp;</p><p>Students regularly pick vegetables and tomatoes galore and donate them to the Plum Market Kitchen staff, who make tasty salads and dishes. Herbs from the garden have created delicious pestos and sauces. Whenever vegetables from the garden are used at lunch, the chefs place signs on the salad bar.</p><p>View pictures on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157647374784467/">Flickr</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eighth graders accompanied their first grade buddies to Miller's Big Red Apple Orchard on Friday, September 19 - a great way for the students to get to know each other! Students, first grade teachers and eighth grade advisors were treated to an informative tour of the orchard in addition to a fun hayride. The tractor driver shared some fun facts about apples and taught the students how to properly pick out the best, ripe apples. Everyone got to pick out their very own bag of apples and also got to do some sampling! Lunch under the pavilion - with donuts and cider for dessert - was followed by a trip to the farm to see pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, hens, llamas and a pony.</p><p>A favorite part of the trip for the students was climbing the huge stacks of hay and playing with their friends and buddy. Everyone - including the teachers - climbed to the top of the hay stack for a group shot.</p><center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20140925124735.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></center><p><br />Afterwards the group went inside to learn about how apple cider is made. They got to see the giant machine and hear all about how the process works. Then they went into a very warm &quot;greenhouse&quot; room and learned about Aquaponics and how tilapia fish and plants help each other grow. They also got to taste some fresh cilantro that was grown in the greenhouse.</p><p>Said first grade teacher Lindsey Furgal: &quot;All day, the students stuck with their buddies. The eighth graders did a fantastic job of watching over the first graders the whole time, and made sure they were safe and having fun!&quot;</p><p>The apple orchard trip is one of many activities the first and eighth grade buddies do together throughout the school year.</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157647603242107/">Click here</a> to view pictures on Flickr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Whether they win or not, students are still demonstrating leadership and initiative.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's a bird... it's a plane... no, it's a high altitude balloon!</p><p>Middle School students in Mr. Rochte's R.E.A.L. class embarked on a near space journey on Thursday, January 29 with the launching of the 30' balloon they built. Although the balloon was launched with helium due to the weather conditions, it was designed to fly throughout the day as a &quot;solar Montgolfiere&quot; or solar hot-air balloon.</p><p>The balloon was equipped with a payload box containing a GPS<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;tracker (which unfortunately malfunctioned) and a mini digital camcorder</span>&nbsp;that was running when it took off. The hope was that the students would be able to witness its journey if the balloon was ever found. A label on the box included instructions for its safe return to GPA.</p><p>&quot;All of our predictions suggested it would land sometime on Wednesday night, probably around 8 p.m., in northwestern Ohio,&quot; said Director of Technology Robert Rochte, who teaches mathematics and computer science in addition to the Near Space Explorations elective. The elective is part of GPA's R.E.A.L. (Real-world Experiences and Applied Learning) program, which provides opportunities for students to engage in real-world tasks that extend classroom learning, employ cross-disciplinary thinking, make connections to the world outside of their classroom walls, and create innovative solutions and products as a result of their hard work.</p><p>The balloon, having completed its descent in the middle of a field, was found by a gentleman from Foster Farms outside of Roanoke, Virginia.</p><p>&quot;We never dreamed it would somehow make it all the way to Virginia!&quot; said Mr. Rochte.&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Foster's call on Friday morning was the talk of the school all day.&quot;</p><p>One early speculation for the balloon's unexpected voyage is that the helium diffusion rate was not as high as expected; with some left-over gas in the balloon, the descent was extremely slow. According to Mr. Rochte, this would have allowed the balloon to travel much farther with the jet stream. He estimates the balloon traveled approximately 400 miles. &quot;Our farthest ever GPA balloon flight was 933 miles, back in March of 2007. That one almost landed in the Atlantic!&quot;</p><p>While the balloon will be returned, it enjoyed a brief detour to Shawsville Middle School in Montgomery County. Before shipping it back to GPA, Drema Foster, the wife of the man who found the balloon, took it to the school for the students to see how it was constructed. She also sent pictures of the area in which it was found.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;You will get an idea of how many mountains surround the area the balloon was found in,&quot; Mrs. Foster wrote to Mr. Rochte in an email. &quot;It's really quite amazing it landed in the middle of a field and not in the woods.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Rochte will download and process the video as soon as he receives the payload back. &quot;It should be fascinating for the students to see it,&quot; he said. &quot;Although I doubt it will include the landing. Oh, how I'd love to see the cows' faces as the balloon touched down!&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157648207990334/">Click here</a>&nbsp;to see pictures of the launch.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Administrators targeting campus upgrades and maintenance with this year's auction</strong></p><div><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150403152533.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" />Heading up the main entry driveway from Lake Shore Road to The Grosse Pointe Academy during these past two weeks, a new visitor might have wondered where everybody was. Only a handful of cars were scattered in the various parking areas on campus and not one smiling student or teacher could be found at this historic school.&nbsp;</div><p>But even though the kids and faculty members were on a well-deserved two-week spring break, there still was much afoot at the Academy.</p><p>&ldquo;Our maintenance staff is very busy these two weeks, especially with an important ISACS accreditation visit scheduled for later this month,&rdquo; said Assistant Head of School Jennifer Kendall. &ldquo;As always, we plan to look our best.&rdquo;</p><p>But looking its best and making sure its students and teachers continue to enjoy one of the most breathtakingly beautiful campuses in the U.S. sometimes takes an almost Herculean effort from those charged with maintaining it.</p><p><strong>Patching walls</strong></p><p>GPA Director of Facilities Kevin Alt said the annual break in the spring is critical to keeping the facilities &ldquo;ship-shape.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150403153022.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;My guys are always busy while school is in session,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we really get down to business during the breaks. It&rsquo;s just so much easier to get the big things done around this place, which requires a phenomenal amount of attention.&rdquo;</p><p>Jon Hume, who is a longtime member of the maintenance staff, said their to-do list is long.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;On top of the many, many requests from teachers for classroom repairs, we&rsquo;re working on painting the breezeway leading to the fieldhouse, replacing light ballasts and ceiling tiles, installing new electrical wiring and doing lots of gutter repairs,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Interior wall repair also is a constant issue for the school, according to Alt. &ldquo;Many of our newer buildings and additions have drywall instead of plaster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve patched well over 50 individual damaged areas in the drywall over this break. This take up a lot of maintenance time.&rdquo;</p><p>Hume said getting the athletic fields in shape for spring sports also was planned for the break. He works with Norman Ender and Ron Edwards as part of the core GPA maintenance staff.</p><p><strong>Raising paddles</strong></p><p>GPA Head of School Lars Kuelling acknowledges that it takes a lot of extra man-hours to maintain such a world-class facility. But he said keeping the facilities&mdash;including buildings nearly 100 years old&mdash;functioning for GPA students also takes extra financial support.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150403153315.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;The portion of our operating budget dedicated to facilities runs about 30% higher than our peer institutions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But even with that level of commitment, we are not able to consistently meet the major maintenance needs here. That&rsquo;s why we are especially hopeful&nbsp;for another successful annual auction, which this year includes a special &lsquo;paddle-raise&rsquo; appeal dedicated to campus buildings and grounds.&rdquo;</p><p>The Academy&rsquo;s biggest annual fundraiser, called Action Auction, is held each May just before Mother&rsquo;s Day. This year, the event will be one night only&mdash;on Saturday, May 9&mdash;and it is open to the public.</p><p>Since 1968, this annual fundraiser has generated more than $14.5 million to help fund the school&rsquo;s academic offerings, raise scholarship and tuition-assistance dollars, and support the preservation of the Academy&rsquo;s historic campus.</p><p>&ldquo;We are guardians of the foundations laid here over a hundred years ago,&rdquo; Kuelling said. &ldquo;We are looking forward to the help we get from our generous community in preserving these historic facilities so that they may continue to provide what is truly a unique learning environment for our students.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Designers and engineers from kindergarten to grade 8 got together recently at The Grosse Pointe Academy to showcase their inventions in the school's own version of a Mini Maker Faire. It's the first time GPA has formally presented this work in a Maker Faire format, but it won't be the last, according to the school's technology and learning specialist, Megan Black.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150320114249.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;Our students have been doing some amazing things with technology over the past few years as part of our vibrant STEAM program,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It just made sense to tie some of it together in a Maker Faire.&rdquo; STEAM refers to GPA&rsquo;s science, technology, engineering, arts and math initiative.</p><p>One of the most interesting projects at the Maker Faire was called &ldquo;squishy circuits,&rdquo; which involved mixing up the right combination of conductive and non-conductive play dough to light up multi-colored diodes. Students as young as five used the doughy material, batteries and a few wires to explore electrical concepts like resistance, conductivity, and parallel and series circuits.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150320114336.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;The kids had to design the circuits and make certain that the insulating play dough was separated from the conducting play dough and that the diodes were facing the correct way,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;Our young electrical engineers were amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, GPA seventh graders were in the lower-school gymnasium during the Maker Faire to show off the robots they designed, built and programmed to play soccer. Using iPads for controllers, the students ran their &ldquo;players&rdquo; through some pretty intricate maneuvers on the gym floor. (See video below.)</p><p>Earlier in the school year, according to Black, GPA eighth graders and their first-grade &ldquo;buddies&rdquo; put on a robot parade of floats highlighting the periodic table of elements.</p><p>&ldquo;The student teams were each responsible for designing and building a robot capable of pulling at least two trailers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These robotic parade floats were a great way of showing just how much they know about chemical elements, their properties and ultimate uses.&rdquo;</p><p>School officials plan to have a teacher Maker Faire on its professional development day in April. Black said next fall there also are plans to have a family Maker Faire event at the school &ldquo;with lots of making, experimenting and tinkering.&rdquo;</p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R29tJNllugg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a recent grey and rainy Tuesday morning on The Grosse Pointe Academy campus, a decidedly upbeat and cheery figure was welcoming first graders to a special assembly in the big music room. Sasha Murphy, a physical education teacher at GPA, brought the kids into the first two rows of chairs set up for a presentation on recycling by Rizzo Environmental Services, whose representative was running a little late.</p><p>No worries, though, because Murphy kept the students properly engaged&mdash;she knows all the younger kids&rsquo; names even though she teaches mostly in the middle school. Rizzo's Victoria Czapski eventually shows up and quickly begins leading the kids through the three Rs of environmental stewardship: reduce, reuse and recycle.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150410154115.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>Murphy coordinated the event because among her many other duties on campus she is GPA's Green School coordinator, a position from which she's helped lead the school to six straight official Green School designations. She obviously knows her way around this Green School and can probably walk blindfolded anywhere on campus without touching a wall. After all, she first set foot on the grounds of GPA in 1986, when she matriculated as a sixth-grade student herself.</p><p><strong>This is how you teach children</strong></p><p>Murphy graduated from GPA and after finishing high school and college, she said coming back to the Academy to work almost seemed predestined. &nbsp;</p><p>&quot;When I had the offer to interview for a position at GPA, I jumped on it and was very excited,&quot; Murphy says. &quot;I wanted to come back and be a part of the caring teachers and loving family environment that I experienced myself.&rdquo;</p><p>She said she loved that the students at the Academy were immersed in so many things&mdash;art, music, athletics, many other extracurriculars and of course, the academics. &quot;Truly something for every type of student,&quot; she said. &quot;To me, this is how you teach children.&quot;</p><p>According to Murphy, teaching children was always part of her life plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Believe it or not, I have consciously known since first grade that I wanted to be a teacher,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I started working with children by babysitting in middle school, then became a camp counselor in high school and college, assistant camp director, camp director and then finally a teacher here at GPA.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In high school, Murphy took child development classes and worked in a day-care center at Grosse Pointe South. In college, she majored in psychology and elementary education and earned a master's in early childhood education.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;However, I did not ever think my educational career would be with adolescents,&quot; she said. &quot;I always thought I would be an elementary teacher. But after a few months of teaching middle school PE here at GPA in 1998, I fell in love with the older kids and have not looked back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I really enjoy helping them, teaching them, addressing their struggles and celebrating their triumphs. I love the fact that they seem to always have such a sense of wonder, love of life and excitement.&quot; &nbsp;</p><p>Lawrence DeLuca, GPA&rsquo;s assistant head of school for instruction and principal for grades 1-8, said Murphy is a real advocate for the students. &ldquo;Sasha is one of the most dedicated teachers I have ever met,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is our P.E. teacher, community service coordinator, NJHS faculty advisor, Student Council advisor, and 6th-Grade advisor.&rdquo;</p><p>DeLuca said Murphy at times is like a second parent to many of the kids. &ldquo;Every day, she meets with students after school to help them get organized with their homework and get caught up with their work.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Mission-driven</strong></p><p>The mission of The Grosse Pointe Academy and its faculty and staff is based on three central tenets: &ldquo;to nurture, to challenge and to inspire&rdquo; students. In Murphy&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s hard to see where any of that doesn&rsquo;t apply.</p><p>&ldquo;I am a total cheerleader for my students,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am on their team no matter what. If they get an A+ or fail a test or are having a really crummy day, no matter what, I am there for them.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>Some kids might just need a hug, she said, some might need help with their homework, or staying organized, or working on improving their citizenship or help remembering to do certain things.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Murphy after school three to five days a week, working with those students who need help. She also offers a study hall for middle-school students. &nbsp;</p><p>And she&rsquo;s a firm believer in practicing what she is preaching to her students.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;As the school&rsquo;s community service coordinator, it's important to me that the kids know I also do community service in my own free time, that I make it a part of my life as well. And, if I&rsquo;m asking them to speak politely to each other, they need to see that I do the same with students and other adults. I am always pushing my students, challenging them to get out of their comfort zone.&rdquo;</p><p>Murphy has herself taken on some challenges of her own with some pretty tough fitness classes and she&rsquo;s working on being a regular runner whenever she&rsquo;s not at school.</p><p><strong>Psychologist?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine Sasha Murphy in a different field of work, and when asked what she might be doing if she wasn&rsquo;t in education, she also has kind of a hard time coming up with something at first.</p><p>But when pressed, she says: &ldquo;In no particular order, private practice or school psychologist, some sort of life coach but more for teens, events coordinator, physical therapist, public relations for a city. . .&rdquo;</p><p>All noble professions. But the Grosse Pointe Academy and its students and staff certainly are glad Murphy has instead dedicated her career to educating those who, like her, will one day make their own mark in the world.<a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[On a recent grey and rainy Tuesday morning on The Grosse Pointe Academy campus, a decidedly upbeat and cheery figure was welcoming first graders to a special assembly in the big music room. Sasha Murphy, a physical education teacher at GPA, brought first graders into the first two rows of chairs set up for a presentation on recycling by Rizzo Environmental Services, whose representative was running a little late. ]]></excerpt:encoded>

The following is what <strong>Megan Black</strong> delivered to those assembled on April 13, 2015. Black is the technology and learning specialist, Grade 4-5 media literacy coordinator and circulation supervisor for the school. One busy and &ldquo;wonder-full&rdquo; person!</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Wonder Talk</strong></span></p><p>April 13, 2015</p><p>&quot;I would like to share with you two stories, three wishes, and an important secret.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I have always been a wonderer. I wonder about stuff. Constantly. Curiosity led me into many embarrassing predicaments. For example, when I was little, I wondered if mothers-to-be got that way because they swallowed a watermelon seed. I wondered what would happen if I tried it. I knew seeds needed dirt so I ate some of that too. Then I sat in a sunny spot until I threw up. But this didn&rsquo;t stop me from wondering if I could make my own gum. That brought the fire department to my house which is a longer story for a different day. I wondered what was in the glove compartment of people&rsquo;s cars parked on our street. I was driven to examine the items in the doctor&rsquo;s cabinets and try to figure out what they did. Let&rsquo;s face it, who doesn&rsquo;t wonder about that?!&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150416091449.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&quot;I became obsessed with the idea that there were hidden rooms in every house and wondered what I needed to do to reveal them. Twist a knob on a mantelpiece, play a few notes on their piano, pull out just the right book from a shelf, and I was hopeful the floor would open up to a descending staircase leading to a chamber filled with magical samurai swords and dusty potions. I admit that I was influenced by the story of Anne Frank, my favorite book, 'The Secret Garden,' and a fair share of Scooby Doo cartoons. Even though my nosiness often led to trouble, and I was almost always caught in the act, I never stopped wondering. I wonder about the word wonder. It can be a synonym for questioning or curiosity but also for awe, astonishment, luminous enchantment, and speechless reverence.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Recently, scientists have studied the phenomenon of wonder, the speechless-reverence-awesome kind, the moments when we are stunned by the elegance of something in nature or life that humbles us and makes us realize that we are part of something grander than we ever imagined. What the scientists have discovered is that these moments change our lives in profound ways. The more often we experience astonishment, the less likely we are to suffer disease, the greater our personal happiness, and the more likely we are to want to contribute to the betterment of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;American biologist and writer Rachel Carson once wrote, 'If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the christening of all children, I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life.' I wish this gift for each of you. That&rsquo;s my first wish.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The first time I truly recall feeling a sense of wonder or awe was when I drove across the country by myself to start a new life in Los Angeles. I had everything I owned in a cruddy little hatchback and I was driving to the second largest city in the U.S. where I didn&rsquo;t know a soul. I had no job or place to live. It was risky but also thrilling. When I got to Arizona, I came down with a terrible cold and the reality that I was headed into a very uncertain future alone began to take hold. Nevertheless, I decided to drive the two hours out of my way to see the Grand Canyon.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I got there late in the afternoon. When you drive in the park you don&rsquo;t see the canyon. You have to walk to the edge. I will never forget it. As I got closer and the sublime immensity of what I was looking at opened up, my legs gave out. I fell to my knees. And I stayed that way for what seemed like hours because time stopped. My life was different after that. I can&rsquo;t tell you about it in words really but noted American author Annie Dillard wrote, 'We wake, if ever at all, to mystery.' And that moment and others I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to experience, mostly in nature, have felt like waking up. . .in a good way, not like with the alarm clock, but after a long, delicious sleep. So, that was the second story. And my second wish is that life presents you with mysteries that bring you to your knees. Many of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Socrates tell us that wonder is the beginning of wisdom. Wonder!</p><p>&quot;Einstein said, 'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science.'&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote, 'Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.' And, that is my third wish, that you learn to love and live the questions and when you find an answer, realize that this is not the end of mystery. Mystery is infinite.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I believe wonder and awe are a form of prayer. Wonder lets us see with new eyes. It&nbsp;connects us to the consciousness of the cosmos. Which leads me to the all important secret. . . Are you ready?! YOU are the greatest wonder of the universe. Yes, you, human, sitting here in this particular body, with this unique mind and heart, in this moment in history, are the greatest wonder of all the galaxies because you get to behold it all. There never was and there never will be another you who notices and feels and appreciates and hopefully loves the other wonders in quite the same way. So, open up and let it all in! Even the stuff that hurts or confuses you. Live the questions! Love the mysteries! Or, as Dr. Seuss says, 'Think and wonder. Wonder and think.'&rdquo;<a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

It was &quot;reduce, reuse and recycle,&quot; and their &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; was Victoria Czapski, the community education coordinator with Rizzo Environmental Services, who took the students through a comprehensive presentation on the importance of recycling and protecting the environment.</p><p>Organized by GPA&rsquo;s Green School Coordinator and P.E. Instructor Sasha Murphy, Wednesday&rsquo;s special assembly was another in a long string of annual activities connected with the school&rsquo;s green initiative. This year is the sixth consecutive year the Academy has received Green School status from the State of Michigan, according to Murphy.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150408152839.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>Among the facts students learned today was that even though 65 percent of all household waste is recyclable, Michigan residents recycle only about 15 percent of their waste and garbage. Czapski told the 1st-3rd graders in the first session this morning that the national average is between 33 and 35 percent, which means &quot;Michigan has a long way to go.&quot;</p><p>Czapski also said that Americans use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour of every day &mdash; an astounding statistic even for the lower school students in attendance.</p><p>A video on how Rizzo recycles what it collects also was shown to the students by Czapski, who said she has given these kinds of presentations to more that 11,000 students since the first of this year. &quot;I&rsquo;m happy to do it, though, because it&rsquo;s an important message to get out to the kids,&quot; she said.</p><p>More photos of today's presentation are available <strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157651821745712/" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.<a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

It&rsquo;s a regular alphabet soup of accreditation, authorization and academic certification. It&rsquo;s confusing to be sure to some in the school community, but nonetheless vital to The Grosse Pointe Academy&rsquo;s continuing growth as a beacon of excellence in early and primary education. &nbsp;</p><p>Among the many accreditations achieved by GPA, perhaps one of the most vital is its ISACS accreditation. The Independent Schools Association of the Central States is a membership organization of more than 230 independent schools from 13 states in the Midwest region of the United States. GPA has been ISACS-accredited for years and shares such accreditation with Cranbrook, Country Day and The Roeper School.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the ISACS mission statement, its purpose is &ldquo;to promote the development of strong learning communities characterized by high achievements, social responsibility, and independence of governance, programs and policies. This goal is achieved through a rigorous accreditation process, targeted professional development programs, and focused support services.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Visiting team commends</strong></p><p>On Wednesday, April 15, a team of 10 educators from other ISACS-member schools concluded a four-day visit to GPA as a part of the school&rsquo;s re-accreditation process. Prior to the visit, GPA faculty, staff, administrators and Board members prepared a 130-page self-study report describing all aspects of GPA's program, operations and school culture.</p><p>According to GPA officials, the ISACS team observed school in session and met with faculty, staff, students, administrators, alumni, Trustees and parents. The team used those observations and meetings to analyze GPA&rsquo;s self-study report and to develop a general overview along with commendations and recommendations for the 31 report areas in the self-study.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We will receive a copy of the ISACS full report by mid-summer,&rdquo; said Head of School Lars Kuelling. &ldquo;And we anticipate notification in the fall of our full continued accreditation as an ISACS member school.&rdquo;</p><p>Prior to departing the Academy on Wednesday, the ISACS visiting team leader, Mike Vachow, who is from the Forsyth School in St. Louis, Missouri, shared his team's overall observations with GPA's faculty and staff, and presented major commendations and recommendations, some of which are highlighted below:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Dedicated, compassionate, flexible, loyal faculty, staff and administration.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; The family feel that characterizes school community.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Leadership of the school at the governance level is intensely focused on the long-term financial sustainability of GPA.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Recognition of and gratitude toward the school&rsquo;s history and heritage.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Courage to explore emerging, distinguishing programs like STEAM, 1-to-1 computing, R.E.A.L., the Garden Classroom.</p><p>&ldquo;We are all grateful to the visiting team members who took time from their own schools to so thoughtfully examine our program and provide what we know will be helpful reflections and suggestions,&rdquo; Kuelling said. &ldquo;I would like to personally thank all of our faculty and staff &mdash; the steering committee, and Janice Sturm, steering committee chair &mdash; for their work and dedication to our school and students over the past two years.

Which local auction fundraiser stands out among others as the premier and signature event that has been held consecutively since 1968? Where do more than 500 of your closest friends annually gather each May to support independent education in the Grosse Pointes? There is only one answer to these questions:</p><p><strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy Fete des Amis Action Auction</strong></p><p>The Academy&rsquo;s renowned and very successful annual fundraiser, Action Auction, is held each May just before Mother&rsquo;s Day.

[caption id="attachment_26766" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/amal_Paris-photo-29_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26766"><img class="wp-image-26766 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/amal_Paris-photo-29_1000px.jpg" alt="amal_paris-photo-29_1000px" width="1000" height="785" /></a> Middle-school French teacher Amal El-Hosni, center, is with fellow teacher Claudia Leslie, far right, and GPA students on one of her annual trips to Europe. El-Hosni’s students routinely score very high on the National French Exam, or "Le Grand Concours," an annual competition sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of French.[/caption]
<p class="p1">When Grosse Pointe Academy middle-school French teacher Amal El-Hosni was growing up in Lebanon, she never dreamed she would one day be a teacher. Her aunt, with whom she was very close, was a pediatrician.</p>
<p class="p1">“I wanted to be just like her,” said El-Hosni.</p>
<p class="p1">But when she started to tutor a much younger student who was having problems with letters and words, she thought teaching might be a possibility for her, even though El-Hosni herself was only 14 at time.</p>
<p class="p1">“I worked with this child every day for two weeks,” she said. “But I was really only a child myself, and I had no idea how to teach him. But I could see that he wasn’t enjoying the process, and that he was becoming very frustrated with himself.”</p>
<p class="p1">So El-Hosni decided to make it fun.</p>
<p class="p1">She cut up pieces of colored paper in order to make a long train with each piece having a letter on it. The two of them then started playing with the paper, making up different trains and words—and then sentences.</p>
<p class="p1">“Something magical happened,” she said. “I swear to this day I could practically hear that boy’s brain racing though letters and words as his little hands were grabbing and aligning the colored paper to drive the train home.”</p>
<p class="p1">That was the clincher. She knew right then that teaching was going to be her life’s calling as she continued tutoring students throughout her high school and early college years in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Coming to the U.S.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">El-Hosni immigrated to the U.S. from Lebanon 27 years ago, first to Los Angeles where as a grad student at California State University she took on work as an assistant professor and later as an adjunct professor. She remained with the university for about seven years until circumstances brought her to Michigan and to Grosse Pointe specifically, where she and her husband decided to settle and raise their family.</p>
<p class="p1">While her kids were young, El-Hosni taught French part-time at Macomb Community College in Warren. In 2000, she was hired as a French teacher at Harper Woods Notre Dame, an all-boys Catholic high school, which was closed by the Archdiocese of Detroit in 2005. She then served as a long-term substitute teacher at Grosse Pointe North High School for one year and Parcells Middle School for another year.</p>
<p class="p1">But, El-Hosni says, she’s learned through the years that everything happens in your life for a reason.</p>
<p class="p1">When a full-time middle-school French teacher position opened up at the Grosse Pointe Academy, a school she admits she knew very little about at the time, El-Hosni nonetheless signed on.</p>
<p class="p1">“All three of my children had gone through a Montessori program in Los Angeles, and I am a great believer and advocate of Montessori, she said. “I had heard some great things about GPA, but I was not familiar with the school. However, as I sat through my first Monday morning chapel assembly, all I could think of was what a great sense of belonging it gave me. I wanted to be part of this community—this family. By the end of my first year, I knew that I wanted to spend the remainder of my teaching years at the Academy.”</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Witness to positive changes at GPA</strong></p>
<p class="p1">El-Hosni says since joining the faculty at the Academy, she’s seen many big changes and improvements at the school.</p>
<p class="p1">“We are a leading school in our area in technology and one-to-one tablet usage,” she said. “And our STEM lab has allowed students to experiment and explore like never before. And let’s not forget the student’s garden, which has become a real gathering space where students, teachers, and sometimes even parents, work, plant, play, eat, or just enjoy reading in the shade.”</p>
<p class="p1">El-Hosni also loves the fact that GPA is not basking in its own glow or resting on its laurels. “It seems we are constantly looking for ways to improve the learning process for our students,” she said. “In my own classes, for example, I try to challenge my students and push them out of their comfort zone. They learn by asking questions, researching topics, coming to logical conclusions through trial and error, even in French grammar and writing. I believe you can’t reach your potential unless you are challenged.”</p>
<p class="p1">But she’s also a big believer in the nurturing part of the school’s central mission.</p>
<p class="p1">“I make sure my students always know they are in a safe environment, and that it’s okay to fall and make mistakes, as long as they are willing to get up and try again. Some students might be afraid or reticent with such an approach, but in the end they usually rise up to the challenge and realize why I was pushing them. After all, this school is all about nurturing potential, and allowing students to discover their own strengths.”</p>
<p class="p1">El-Hosni’s own three children, who are all pretty much on their own now, were raised with the same philosophy, she said, where good enough is not good enough.</p>
<p class="p1">It appears that her kids definitely benefitted from such an approach.</p>
<p class="p1">“My oldest studied engineering at U-M, then finished and MBA at Maryland University,” El-Hosni said. “Today she handles international business development for a defense company and lives in Washington, DC, with her husband. My youngest went into engineering as well, and lives in Chicago. He is working for Union Pacific, and is living every little boy’s dream of working with trains.” Her other daughter will be graduating in a couple of weeks from medical school, where she is specializing in both internal medicine and pediatrics.</p>
<p class="p1">El-Hosni is glad her children are doing well and on their own now. It gives her even more time to concentrate on her charges at the Academy.</p>
<p class="p1">It is apparent that she just flat out loves her job and loves teaching. “Bearing witness to these young people when they have their epiphanies about who they can be and what they can achieve is the greatest pleasure and honor in the world,” she said. “I’m not going anywhere else anytime soon!”</p>

G.R.O.W. stands for Generating Real Opportunities for Wonder. Fellow G.R.O.W. tutors and GPA students Emma Smith, Nafi Sall and Shekinah Aho also help Fields when and where needed.</p><p class="p2">Technology and Learning Specialist Megan Black says Fields pretty much manages the G.R.O.W. program on her own. &quot;Maria runs everything and even provides the snacks,&quot; Black said. But all the students are truly remarkable.&quot;</p><p class="p2">According to Head of School Lars Kuelling, Fields is one of GPA's Academy Scholars and has been heavily involved with many school initiatives. &quot;Maria helped host the Catch Night of Champions event last October in front of 400 attendees,&quot; he noted.</p><p class="p1">School officials will be on hand May 13 at the Optimist Club in Clinton Township when Fields accepts her award from club members.</p><p>Her essay is reproduced in its entirety below.</p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;How My Optimism Will Help Me Press On To 'Greater Achievements of the Future&quot;</strong></em></p><p><em>By Maria Fields</em></p><p><em>The human spirit's capacity to dream, learn and grow is infinite.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>My tutoring program G.R.O.W., Generate Real Opportunities and Wonder, is based on the highest technological premise there is, human potential is limitless. G.R.O.W. strives to make the future of every child a bright and successful.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>But G.R.O.W. was not created over night. In addition to thoughtful planning and preparation, it took inspiration. The Optimist Creed, authored by Christian D. Larson helped to supply that inspiration. Using key lines from Mr. Larson&rsquo;s timeless classic as my guide, the G.R.O.W. tutoring program is based on principles of peace, kindness and understanding. I will share some of the lines that were the most meaningful to me.</em></p><p><em>The first and most important line of The Optimist Creed is: Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb my piece of mind.</em></p><p><em><strong>Promise Yourself</strong></em></p><p><em>This phrase has a puissant meaning. I know from experience that promising yourself can take you beyond the limits of what you think or believe is possible. If I had not made up my mind and promised myself to start a tutoring program, It probably wouldn't exist.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>When I decided to develop a tutoring program, I felt it was the right thing to do. I have always had a talent for helping, especially when it came to helping kids learn new concepts at school. So, by the time I started 6th grade, I was very passionate about it, and that was the same year I decided to go a step farther and join a tutoring program at my church. While there, I was able to observe, one on one, the positive effects of influencing education and learning into young minds. After all, said Buddha, a journey of a thousand miles, begins with a single step.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em><strong>To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every living thing you meet.</strong></em></p><p><em>When I worked as a tutor at my church, I learned that one of the most important things was to approach everyone with a smile. How could anyone disagree with wisdom from Mother Teresa? She said, &quot;Every time you smile at someone,it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.&quot;</em></p><p><em>I agree. I found out that being positive brought positive results from my tutees. Several times I have had students show up disgruntled and unhappy, but when I smiled at them their whole disposition changed. And they were pleasant throughout the entire session.</em></p><p><em><strong>To make all my friends feel that there is worthwhile something in them.</strong></em></p><p><em>I worked with one tutee who was struggling to find her place in the world of education. In fact, her poor self image begun to interfere with her work. I knew that I had to turn her in a different direction because, &quot;No one has ever made himself great by showing how small someone else is,&quot; said Irvin Himmel, automobile designer</em></p><p><em>Once I began to work with her, the outcomes improved. Her reading advanced, and when she did her journaling, her inner creativity blossomed.</em></p><p><em>The wisdom of the The Optimist&rsquo;s Creed was really making me look at the sunny side of everything and make my optimism come true.</em></p><p><em>This was the key to the locked door of starting my tutoring program. It allowed me to push all the doubts and worries out of my mind and focus on establishing G.R.O.W.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>&quot;If you can imagine it, you can achieve it, if you can dream it, you can become it,&quot; said William Arthur Ward, inspirational writer</em></p><p><em>I have always dreamed of doing something to change the world. Then, like seeing a gift of a falling star, it came to me. I could do something to change to world, and at the same time engage in something that I loved! I could start a tutoring program! Where kids, like myself, would tutor younger kids. And what's a better way to begin changing the world than starting with the people who will inhabit it next?</em></p><p><em>During the first year of tutoring at my church, I learned that saying one simple phrase like &quot;Good job!&quot; and &quot;Wow! You&rsquo;re Smart!&quot; when a child got an answer correct, really made them feel special, which made me feel good, too, proving the line To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.</em></p><p><em>&quot;Success isn't just about what you accomplish in your life, it's about what you inspire others to do.&quot; -- author unknown</em></p><p><em>And here&rsquo;s my favorite line from The Optimist&rsquo;s Creed: To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the great achievements of the future.</em></p><p><em>October 28, 2014, was the official start of the G.R.O.W. Tutoring program. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy. At first, we didn&rsquo;t have enough kids to tutor. Then, we didn&rsquo;t have enough tutors! It was a very challenging period. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&quot;If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means 'First Attempt In Learning.'&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>End is not the end, if fact E.N.D. means 'Effort Never Dies.'&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>If you get No as an answer, remember N.O. means 'Next Opportunity.'&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So Let's be positive. &quot; -- A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, former president of India.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;So, the next time you find yourself &quot;F.A.I.L&quot;ing, just remember it's your First Attempt In Learning.</em></p><p><em>But I would not be discouraged, because the Creed instructed me &ldquo;To think well of yourself and proclaim this fact to the world, not in loud word, but in great deeds.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&quot;The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,&quot; said Mahatma Gandhi.</em></p><p><em>And now the good news! G.R.O.W. Is starting to grow! I am currently in negotiations to implement G.R.O.W. in the community.</em></p><p><em>The closing line of The Optimist&rsquo;s Creed gave me the courage to know that everything would be okay. To live in the faith that the whole world is on my side, so long as I am true to the best that is in me.</em></p><p><em>&quot;The futures bright, wear your sunglasses,&quot; said Ian Somerhalder, actor</em></p><p><em>Get ready to G.R.O.W., because G.R.O.W. Tutoring is on its way to a bright, successful future and is prepared to Generate Real Opportunities and Wonder! Which will prove the motto of the tutoring program, &quot;The more you know, the more you grow!&quot;</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;Thank you!</em></p><p class="p1"><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

Initial steps have included:</p><p>&bull; the creation of the Innovation &amp; Design Center and Garden Classroom</p><p>&bull; the reroofing of the entire Early School</p><p>&bull; the planting of the F&ecirc;te des Amis Garden in the Main School driveway&nbsp;</p><p>&bull; the refinishing of the Main School doors</p><p>&bull; the laying of a slate patio as step one in the restoration of the Lake Shore Heart&nbsp;</p><p>Kuelling said that as impressive as the GPA campus is, people often take it for granted, not fully understanding that its age, size and location present significant difficulties in terms of balancing historical preservation with everyday use.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The portion of our operating budget dedicated to facilities runs about 30% higher than our peer institutions, and even with that level of commitment, we are not able to consistently meet the major maintenance and upgrade needs of our beautiful facilities,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Continue making progress</strong></p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150505145449.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p>In order to build off of the momentum generated through the first phase of improvements, school officials look to address the following initiatives by successfully raising $100,000 through this year&rsquo;s Action Auction paddle raise:</p><p>&bull; new signage to better identify our campus</p><p>&bull; Nuns&rsquo; Walk restoration</p><p>&bull; tuck-pointing at the Main and Early Schools</p><p>&bull; driveway resealing</p><p>&bull; installation of an integrated camera/intercom door entry system</p><p>&bull; upgrade of phone system</p><p>&ldquo;Our children are setting perhaps the finest example of stewardship in the great care they take in maintaining the garden classroom,&rdquo; Kuelling added. &ldquo;It is time for us to follow their lead as we continue the first phase of our facilities plan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Kuelling acknowledged that these much-needed repairs and maintenance efforts may not generate the same kind of excitement as curriculum development, for example, &ldquo;but they do play an important role in sustaining and protecting the nurturing learning environment inherent in a Grosse Pointe Academy education. Let&rsquo;s meet and exceed our goal of $100,000,&quot; he said. &quot;The more support we receive, the more we can do &mdash; raise your paddle high!&rdquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy boasts some of the best and brightest when it comes to its faculty. That is beyond obvious. But what may not be quite so obvious is how dedicated they are to improving their craft.</p><p>PD days, or professional development days, for teachers are a regular feature at the Academy, the most recent occurring on April 6 on the school&rsquo;s campus.&nbsp;PD days usually occur during the school year and during a regular school day when classes are not in session.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150506165411.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>But this Saturday, May 9, when most other teachers are enjoying a well-deserved day off, a host of faculty members from GPA will be heading to Detroit&rsquo;s Wayne State University for a completely voluntary day-long session of professional collaboration called &ldquo;#edcamp Detroit.&rdquo;</p><p>Sponsored and hosted by WSU&rsquo;s College of Education, #edcamp Detroit has been branded as an &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; by organizers, who say their goal is to &ldquo;bring educators together to share their passion and ideas for better learning in an open format. It&rsquo;s a conference for educators, by educators, and anyone who shows up at the event can sign up to host a session, on any topic they choose.&rdquo;</p><p>Megan Black, GPA&rsquo;s technology and learning specialist, is organizing the school&rsquo;s #edcamp Detroit contingent. She says GPA teachers will be joining hundreds of other teachers from the Detroit area for a decidedly different form of professional teacher development.</p><p>&ldquo;I've been an &lsquo;Edcamper&rsquo; since its inception and am a huge fan of the unconference concept,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;And we should have one of the strongest showings in southeast Michigan. Quite a feat for such a relatively small staff!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>There were over 255 Edcamps last year, according to the Edcamp Foundation. From May 2010, when Edcamps began, through December 2014, there have been more than 630 Edcamps held, mostly in the U.S. Originating in the Philadelphia area in 2010, Edcamps have spread across both the U.S. and Canada and are becoming more popular in other countries, including one scheduled this year in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p><p>Saturday&rsquo;s &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; at WSU will be the fifth such large-scale event in Detroit. Black noted that GPA also has hosted its own versions of Edcamp, with technology integration as the theme for 2014 and micro-learning for this year.</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

In the photo below, Hogle is with her husband, Paul, after the ceremony.)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;At a breakfast this morning sponsored by the Race Relations &amp; Diversity Task Force, based in Birmingham, Mich., Grosse Pointe Academy music teacher Lauri Hogle was honored as a &ldquo;diversity champion.&rdquo;</p><p>The Race Relations &amp; Diversity Task Force recognizes individuals in the Detroit area whose vision of diversity has created a significant impact on others and &ldquo;make an invaluable contribution by helping to ensure that all people feel included and empowered in the shared endeavors of your organization and in our larger community.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Hogle, the greatest form of social justice is &quot;to give the highest quality education to every child.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150507151614.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>And she goes out of her way to ensure this belief permeates every aspect of her life and work.</p><p>She began her career providing music therapy to children with special needs and then moved on to direct award-winning church and school choirs in Washington, DC, and Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>Hogle currently teaches GPA&rsquo;s middle-school music classes. She&rsquo;s also the artistic director of the Detroit Children&rsquo;s Choir in partnership with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The DCC&rsquo;s mission is to use the power of choral music education as a cultural platform to unite children of diverse backgrounds. Its nine choirs offer performance opportunities that are life changing in scope.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Criteria</strong></p><p>According to the Race Relations &amp; Diversity Task Force, its goal is to build awareness among area organizations in relation to issues of diversity and inclusion, to stimulate the adoption and implementation of express policies supportive of diversity and to promote the mission of the task force.</p><p>Further, they say a diversity champion will &quot;be the conscience of an organization, not settle for the status quo, embody the ideals of an organization, envision new ways of inclusion, be a doer whose actions speak of respect for others, be someone whose &ldquo;circle of influence&rdquo; represents many kinds of people, and be an advocate who speaks out against insensitivity and prejudice.&quot;</p><p>Also, consistent with the task force goals, a diversity champion may be someone who has helped an organization adopt or implement a policy supportive of diversity and the ideas of inclusion.</p><p>The Grosse Pointe Academy cannot think of anyone more deserving of this honor than Lauri Hogle.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Six score in the 95th percentile nationally</strong></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150511151757.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>Middle school students from the Grosse Pointe Academy learned recently that their scores in Le Grand Concours, a highly competitive French exam sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of French (AATF), were ranked very high compared with national and local results.</p><p>This is the ninth straight year that GPA students have participated in the national competition and once again, many have done exceedingly well. Of the nineteen students, 15 received medals, with six earning gold medals by placing in the 95th percentile in the nation, eight earning silver medals by placing in the 85th-90th percentile and one earning a bronze medal by placing in the 75th-80th percentile.

Eighth-grade gold medalists Samantha Savage and Henry Whitaker each scored a #4 ranking nationally and a #4 ranking for the local chapter.</p><p>According to middle school French and social studies teacher Amal El-Hosni, the purpose of Le Grand Concours test is to help stimulate further interest in the teaching and learning of French as well as to help identify and reward student achievement.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This sixty-minute national examination is a multiple-choice test of approximately 70 items covering listening comprehension, vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Students take tests that are appropriate for the French curriculum in which they are enrolled and their scores are then ranked against national and local students who are enrolled in similar curricula.&rdquo;</p><p>El-Hosni said the test is a very good indication of how the Academy&rsquo;s French program is fairing compared to hundreds of schools at the national level.</p><p>A summary of GPA student results are shown below, with national percentile, followed by national rank and Detroit chapter rank.

The DCC's Concert Chorale and the newly formed Music Across Detroit Choir for older teens performed Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>Academy students who participated in the concert were: Haleigh Howard, Selga Jansons, Isabella Tomlinson, Angelo Cracchiolo, Megan Driver, Brooke Popadich, Sadie Kuelling, Julia Hartnett, Courtney Mecke, Caya Craig and Evelyn Doan.</p><p>GPA's Hogle, who came to the Detroit area in 2010, has been working with choirs of all ages for over two decades.

She is the former organist for the National Christian Choir, based in Washington, D.C., and has served as director of choruses at both high school and middle school levels in various states, with her students earning superior ratings and top awards, including a Carnegie Hall performance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150515075434.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>What do you call a group of five dads who got together five years ago because of a huge shared passion for Montessori education? And what do you call that same group who decided last April to fly a large banner over Manhattan with a cryptic message for the mayor: &ldquo;Bill de Blasio, make it Montessori.&rdquo; And finally, what do you call these five guys who call Montessori teachers not teachers, but &ldquo;artists&rdquo; and &ldquo;alchemists?&rdquo;</p><p>You call them &ldquo;Montessori Madmen,&rdquo; of course.</p><p>Trevor Eissler, chief madman, who when he&rsquo;s not piloting corporate planes is tirelessly tooting the Montessori horn for anybody who will listen, says the innovative academic philosophy that has been at GPA longer than any other school in Michigan is &ldquo;simply the best way to educate children, period.&rdquo;</p><p>In an interview earlier this week with the Grosse Pointe Academy, it is clear Eissler remains very passionate about Montessori, even though he said his own three kids have &ldquo;aged out of their local Montessori school in Texas.&rdquo;</p><p>He talked about how the Madmen got started.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150515075507.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p>It began about five years ago, he said, with a group of four other &ldquo;Montessori men&rdquo; he actually had never met in person. These dads had read Eissler&rsquo;s book, &quot;Montessori Madness,&rdquo; and got in touch with him to say how fired up they also were about Montessori.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Each seemed surprised that they weren't the only crazy male out there in the seemingly 99% female-dominated world of early childhood education,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My book targeted dads and explained Montessori education from a dad's point of view. These dads were enthusiastic, and wanted to make a difference. We've since added a few more dads.&rdquo; Plus, a few women have infiltrated the fraternity, he said.</p><p>Eissler said his loosely assembled group works in spurts, not talking for several weeks or months and then all of a sudden doing &ldquo;some wacky Montessori ad project like flying a banner plane over NYC or putting up road billboards.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s not all wackiness, though, for the 41-year-old Eissler. He&rsquo;s dead serious when asked about Montessori and where he thinks it fits in the overall spectrum of elementary education.&nbsp;</p><p>Is it progressive? Traditional? Somewhere in the middle?</p><p>&ldquo;It's not really on that spectrum,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Montessori has something revelatory for everyone on the spectrum. And, it can appear contradictory to all those folks. Independence AND community? Structure AND freedom? Self-directed AND teacher-guided? Group work AND solitary work? Leader AND follower?&rdquo;</p><p>And where does he think Montessori works best? Younger early school students? Middle school? All of the above?</p><p>&ldquo;Maria Montessori thought the first six years of life were the most critical,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't have any information to contradict that.&rdquo;</p><p>Find out more about the Montessori Madmen at <a href="http://montessorimadmen.com" target="_blank">montessorimadmen.com</a>, which states the group&rsquo;s central mission: &ldquo;To advocate for Montessori education so that one day it's not called Montessori school; it's just called school.&rdquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

Alatorre noted that the GPA students were up against primarily high-school students.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150521170209.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>A bronze medal was awarded to 8th-grader Johnnae Curry, who scored a 140/125 (student score/national average) on the first day and a 165/124 on the second.</p><p>&ldquo;The proficiency test, which is my favorite, is based in real-life situations, such as articles from magazines, billboards, newspaper articles, etc.,&rdquo; Alatorre said. &ldquo;The listening part of the proficiency test is interpreting regular-speed conversations between native speakers, such as those on radio and TV shows.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to Curry's bronze medal, GPA&nbsp;8th-grader Kendall Adams and 7th-graders Shekinah Aho, Katherine Gray, Joshua Roberts, Christopher Scupholm and Emma Smith earned &ldquo;honor roll&rdquo; medals as result of their performance on the test.</p><p>&ldquo;Attaining a medal or honors for any student on the National Spanish Examinations is very prestigious,&rdquo; said Kevin Cessna-Buscemi, national director of the exams.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the National Spanish Examinations</strong></p><p>The National Spanish Examinations are administered each year in grades 6 through 12, and are sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. They are the most widely used tests of Spanish in the United States. In the spring of 2014, a total of 154,268 students participated in the online version of the exam.</p><p>&nbsp;<a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150506085254.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" /><strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">(In the photo above, Grosse Pointe Academy graduate George Spica works on a sculpture at Interlochen this year. In photo below, Spica, while still a student at GPA, is at his sister Helen's graduation from Interlochen. Spica is attending NYU&rsquo;s renowned Steinhardt School beginning this fall.)</strong></p><p>It's not hard to see why George Spica has done so well at the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy. He's talented, well-spoken and well-focused on a top-notch art education and ultimately a career as a professional artist. But, he says, it's his Grosse Pointe Academy experience that gave him the well-rounded educational foundation so critical to high school and college success.</p><p>&ldquo;I attended GPA from preschool to grade eight and what I now realize is that the tradition and rigor that characterizes a GPA education is in fact what enabled me to engage in more unorthodox means of learning in my high school years,&rdquo; Spica said. &ldquo;In other words, I was so comfortable and well-versed in my academics after graduating from the Academy, I was far more open to the idea of alternative-learning methods as I matured in the context of an art school.&rdquo;</p><p>Spica graduated from Interlochen this past spring. He says that in addition to his years of education at GPA, he also has benefited tremendously from his four years at the highly touted art school located in northern Michigan. He said most Interlochen graduates leave with a better arts education than many graduates of university programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why he was so careful in choosing a college.</p><p>Even though Spica was accepted at the acclaimed Bard College in New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was offered a substantial scholarship, it was the reputation of New York University&rsquo;s Steinhardt School that takes him to Greenwich Village this fall to study visual arts.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Having seen many art colleges and their appeals to Interlochen students, it became clear that attending a typical art college would be a repetition of the instruction I received at Interlochen,&rdquo; Spica said. &ldquo;And, in many cases, with lesser facilities and fewer resources.&rdquo;</p><p>So it was his desire to combine a rigorous academic program with a well-regarded arts education that drove him to apply to Steinhardt at NYU. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small, artistically, academically, and culturally motivated institution within a highly resourceful and renowned university,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>Family affair</strong></p><p>As Spica buttoned up his high-school education at Interlochen, he looked back without regret that he didn&rsquo;t take a more local and conventional secondary-school path. Many GPA graduates go on to well-respected high schools in the area. Schools like Detroit Country Day, Cranbrook and University Liggett. But for Spica, even though Interlochen was kind of pre-ordained &mdash; his parents met there and his older siblings also attended &mdash; it was much more than that.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150506085432.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;I realized Interlochen is a Spica family tradition, but it became something far more comprehensive for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would not be the student I am today if not for the genuinely unique education I received at Interlochen. The curriculum comprises two high school schedules, one academic and one artistic, which eventually led me realize how integral academia is to the creation of well-informed, thought-provoking art. After four years, I can say that what upheld my academic record and my interest in the liberal arts was my parallel study of conceptual art within the studio.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Award-winning art</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=565" target="_blank">Spica&rsquo;s work in the studio</a> also has led to a number of national awards for him, including a visual arts award by the National YoungArts Foundation, non-profit organization that recognizes and nurtures some of the the nation&rsquo;s most talented young artists. The award also gave Spica and other winners the opportunity to spend a week in Miami for workshops with renowned visual artists and to experience and witness performances by artists practicing in other disciplines.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the YoungArts Foundation, previous YoungArts winners include actresses Viola Davis and Kerry Washington, four-time Tony Award nominee Ra&uacute;l Esparza, recording artists Nicki Minaj and Chris Young, musicians Terence Blanchard and Jennifer Koh, choreographer Desmond Richardson, and internationally acclaimed multimedia-artist Doug Aitken.</p><p>Spica&rsquo;s work at Interlochen also earned him a national gold medal and two silver medals from the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers, which confers awards though its annual Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards competition.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Entering the Scholastic competition was a massive application process in which I submitted over 20 works of sculpture, installation and video for review,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The work then was evaluated regionally by local cultural institutions &mdash; in my case within Michigan &mdash; after which I was awarded gold and silver &lsquo;keys.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Spica&rsquo;s gold key work was then evaluated by Scholastic on the national level, which is how he earned his gold and silver medals.</p><p>But awards and medals aside, Spica said his career and life goals are a bit more concrete and tangible.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It is my hope that I can establish an independent studio and practice as a professional artist after receiving my degree from NYU and during graduate school where I plan to pursue a master&rsquo;s degree in fine art.&ldquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

From TIME magazine: &ldquo;Osmo&rsquo;s &lsquo;reflective AI&rsquo; attachment enables the iPad camera to interpret physical objects &mdash; allowing kids to mimic an onscreen pattern with colored tiles, for example, and get rewarded for doing it correctly (while also refining their motor skills).&rdquo;</p><p>Megan Black, technology and learning specialist for the Grosse Pointe Academy, says Osmo was added to many classrooms in the Early School through Grade 5 this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The students love &lsquo;playing beyond the screen,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Osmo developed free apps that work with their device to allow students to use hands-on physical objects, such as letters, tangrams, paper and many of the drawing tools from the real world.&rdquo;</p><p>Black said that by using the little add-on that comes with the kit over the camera lens on an iPad, the students&rsquo; creations are mirrored to the tablet and vice versa so that they can physically interact with the apps. &ldquo;Osmo acts as as natural bridge from Montessori-based learning to effective technology integration,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Black also noted that with &ldquo;Buy One, Give One,&rdquo; new promotional program from Osmo, parents can purchase a kit for home use and the company will donate a second one free of charge to the classroom of their choice.

But most also would say it's a necessary exercise to explain the deeper meaning and purpose of their work. For students, whether in secondary school or post-secondary school, the artist statement in many cases is a requirement for graduation.</p><p>But for George Spica, a former Grosse Pointe Academy student who is graduating this spring from Interlochen Arts Academy in upper Michigan, his artist statement is as eloquent as his art is compelling. Soon to be a visual-arts major at NYU's prestigious Steinhardt School, Spica wraps up his run at Interlochen with the following statement about his senior portfolio. Enjoy.</p><p><strong>George Spica Artist Statement (Interlochen Arts Academy)</strong></p><p>&quot;My work has always been physical, it was borne out of an insular search for the limitations of my own body, but resulted in something far more comprehensive. Capitalizing on the conventional relationships between human consciousness and tactile objects, I have sought to evoke, within those relationships, simply what I perceive to be beautiful. Specifically, achieved through an exhaustive studio practice, beauty in my eyes has manifested itself as the performative potential of the body. It is this potential which is emblematic for me, not simply as a nuance of aesthetic preference, but as a universal experience; one that transcends denominations of sex or capability. Objects and environments that propose, to their viewers, a predisposed affinity with objective physicality through the reference of utility and sport.</p><p>Read more and see Spica's senior portfolio here &gt;&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://interlochenvisualarts.org/george-spica-2015/2015/4/16/george-spica"><strong>George Spica - Interlochen</strong></a></p><p><a style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;" class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img border="0" width="106" height="16" rel="lightbox" alt="Share" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150529120643.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p><center><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;</span></center><p>Some of Carmella Goree&rsquo;s favorite memories of The Grosse Pointe Academy involve a 4th-grade special activity, a great 8th-grade trip to Ohio and graduation. But it&rsquo;s clear that from her first days on campus as a three-year-old Montessori student to finishing up as an 8th-grader in 2011, she was paying close attention to everything else in the classroom and beyond at this highly accredited private school in Grosse Pointe Farms.</p><p>Goree recently learned that she&rsquo;s been named a REBUILD Detroit Scholar, which brought from the University of Detroit Mercy a scholarship totaling more than $140,000. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, a Rebuild Detroit scholarship is designed to encourage more undergraduate students to pursue careers in biomedical research. It is a partnership between the University of Detroit Mercy, Marygrove College, Wayne County Community College District and Wayne State University and is supported by a $21.2 million grant from the NIH.</p><p>Goree, who just graduated from Grosse Pointe South High School, plans to eventually land in medical school and work in urban America afterward.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I want to go into the more impoverished areas of cities like Detroit and find out what is affecting the health and well-being of the citizens,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find solutions for them, especially focusing on the health of young people and young athletes.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Scholarly success</strong></p><p>Goree says that getting to her final decision on a university was difficult, but a &ldquo;good difficult.&rdquo; Besides U-D Mercy, she was accepted at and received scholarship offers from a number of other prestigious universities, but she thought UDM overall was the best fit.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel that U of D will offer me the most support,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I think it will be the right nurturing environment in order for me to succeed.&rdquo;</p><p>Success is something Goree appears to know very well. Among many accolades received during her tenure at GPA, she was inducted into the National Junior Honor Society as a 6th-grader and as a 7th-grader was the recipient of the Thelma Fox Murray Scholarship Award, which is given each year to an upcoming 8th-grade girl who demonstrates integrity, humility, a sense of humor, athletic achievement and overall academic excellence. She also was chosen to give the student &ldquo;state of the school&rdquo; address earlier this year.</p><p>But the academic foundation Goree received at the Academy was more than just awards and society memberships. She said GPA was a big part of why she did so well in high school.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Grosse Pointe Academy offered such a wide variety within every class, we were able to explore our interests in many ways,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then, when I got to South, I was able to choose the classes I wanted based more on my interests.</p><p>&ldquo;With the help of the Academy, I was able to broaden my visions beyond the norm and find my own niche.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Fond memories</strong></p><p>Goree said she has a lot of great memories from her time at the Academy.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150529120059.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;One of my fondest memories is from Mrs. Demartini&rsquo;s 4th-grade &lsquo;breakfast club Wednesdays&rsquo; when each week a student had a chance to bring in and share with the class what they might have for breakfast in their own home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was a fun experience, especially when it was my turn and my mother and I brought in chicken and waffles for the class!&rdquo;</p><p>It is also worth noting that Goree was the only girl in her 8th-grade graduating class of 16 at GPA. But she remembers it never being an issue at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even though I was the only girl in the grade, the boys really took care of me throughout our whole last year at GPA,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We had a great 8th-grade trip to Ohio, great times in classes and they all bought me flowers at graduation. To this day they will always be my brothers.&rdquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img border="0" width="106" height="16" rel="lightbox" alt="Share" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150603104419.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p><p>When compared with other 8th-grade classes at The Grosse Pointe Academy, the Class of 2011&rsquo;s stellar academic successes are not that unusual. Many in the class, which started college this fall, were accepted to prestigious universities to study everything from engineering and visual arts to biomedical research. Other GPA classes likewise have found themselves with similar opportunities in post-secondary institutions.</p><p>But for the 16 students who finished up at 171 Lake Shore Road in June of 2011, two things might stand out. One, there were 15 boys and only one girl in the class.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s the second thing that might really make one stop and stare.&nbsp;</p><p>According to school officials, well over $1.5 million in academic scholarships have been offered to date to those 16 students. That works out to about $100,000 average in scholarship offers for each grad, an impressive number any way it&rsquo;s measured and more than any other GPA class in recent memory.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150603103208.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>Carmella Goree (pictured at right) is one of those grads. She learned that she&rsquo;s been named a REBUILD Detroit Scholar, which brought from the University of Detroit Mercy a scholarship totaling more than $140,000. She is now attending UDM, but that decision wasn&rsquo;t easy for her, especially since she received significant offers from a number of other prestigious universities.</p><p>Goree graduated this spring from Grosse Pointe South High School and she credits her GPA education for getting her through a successful high school career and for setting her up for college.</p><p>&ldquo;Grosse Pointe Academy offered such a wide variety within every class, we were able to explore our interests in many ways,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then, when I got to South, I was able to choose the classes I wanted based more on my interests. With the help of the Academy, I was able to broaden my visions beyond the norm and find my own niche.&rdquo;</p><p>Goree&rsquo;s fellow GPA alum, George Spica, also appears to have benefitted from his time at GPA. He was accepted at the acclaimed Bard College in New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was offered a substantial scholarship. But it was an offer from New York University&rsquo;s Steinhardt School that took him to Greenwich Village this fall to study visual arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Spica, who finished up at the Interlochen Arts Academy in the spring, said GPA also set him up for a secondary and post-secondary education in the arts.</p><p>&ldquo;I attended GPA from preschool to grade eight and what I now realize is that the tradition and rigor that characterizes a GPA education is in fact what enabled me to engage in more unorthodox means of learning in my high school years,&rdquo; Spica said. &ldquo;In other words, I was so comfortable and well-versed in my academics after graduating from the Academy, I was far more open to the idea of alternative-learning methods as I matured in the context of an art school.&rdquo;</p><p>Spica and Goree&rsquo;s classmates R.J. McCarren, Jared Brush, Mac Carroll, Matthew Homsy, Joseph Cavataio, Jack Weaver, Nikolas Minanov, Charles Becker, Andrew Almasy, Jonathan Valente, James Scott, Sam Williams, McCalla Mecke and Michael Schaller fill out the rest of GPA&rsquo;s Class of 2011. They too received acceptances or many large scholarship offers from a long list of universities that includes Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Case Western, Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech and USC.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html"><span class="s1"><b>Online Admissions Inquiry form</b></span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img border="0" width="106" height="16" rel="lightbox" alt="Share" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

Jared Sykes.&nbsp;</p><p>Kuelling wanted to make sure all involved knew how grateful he and the rest of the Academy administration were for all of the hard work. &ldquo;I would like to thank everyone who had a part in this tremendous event, especially our co-chairs, Fay and Paul Savage and Lindsey and Tom Buhl, who put in a great deal of voluntary time in order to ensure the success of this year&rsquo;s auction.&rdquo;</p><p>Kristen Van Pelt, GPA&rsquo;s development director, said proceeds from the auction&mdash;the school&rsquo;s 48th&mdash;will go to enrich academic offerings, raise scholarship and tuition assistance funds, and support the preservation of the Academy&rsquo;s historic campus.</p><p>See photos from the <strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157652450240649" target="_blank">2015 Action Auction here</a></strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gpacademy/sets/72157653841750299" target="_blank"><strong>Click here to view &quot;step and repeat&quot; photos of those attending the Academy's 2015 Action Auction.</strong></a></p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

Minanov, also a two-year starter on varsity for the Blue Devils, received All-Regional honors and will be attending Davidson College in the fall.</p><p>The Blue Devil's move up to D1 play this year came with a much more rigorous schedule. They ended up as champions of the MAC Red conference, defeating the perennially tough Utica Eisenhower team twice. In the regional semifinals, South won in overtime against Troy and advanced to the regional championship where they fell to a strong Country Day team. Coach Wolford said the 2015 Blue Devils squad was &ldquo;one of the best teams I&rsquo;ve ever coached!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div><div><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2 1/2 through Grade 8.

He gave a big shout-out for GPA&rsquo;s chemistry class, saying that it definitely prepared him well for high school chemistry, which led to him placing out of all of his required U-M chemistry classes&mdash;even though he only took one honors chemistry class at Cranbrook.</p><p>Cavataio is proud of his accomplishments at Cranbrook&mdash;and there are many&mdash;but he is most proud of the nonprofit he founded at the school to help children around the world. Called &ldquo;Cranes for Change,&rdquo; Cavataio&rsquo;s organization has provided assistance to children from Brazil, Haiti and Indonesia, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We also organized and conducted a mission to Nicaragua during my junior year where we donated a computer and books to a rural school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And during my senior year, we visited Honduras and worked with another nonprofit organization that aids needy children. Cranes for Change also is planning to use much of its funds to build a rural school in Honduras.&rdquo;</p><p>Among Cavataio&rsquo;s other accomplishments and accolades received during his time at Cranbrook were making the Dean's list every semester he was there, a Chinese award as a freshman, a high finish in the Chinese Quiz Bowl, and scoring superior ratings in both Bach and Schoolcraft piano competitions. (Cavataio has studied and played classical piano for 12 years.)</p><p>He also was captain of the C-K tennis team during his senior year, nominated for a scholar-athlete award and received most valuable player honors in varsity tennis for the Cranes. And if all of that didn&rsquo;t keep him busy enough, Cavataio was a member of the school&rsquo;s robotics team, soccer club and Entrepreneur Club.</p><p><strong>Well prepared</strong></p><p>At Michigan, Cavataio plans to study physics and engineering.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am interested in both medicine and engineering and thought this would be a great way to combine both fields of interest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Students who major in engineering and physics typically score the highest on the MCATs (Medical College Admission Test) so it's a great vehicle to medical school if I chose to go that route.&rdquo;</p><p>As far as what kind of engineering he will study in college, he&rsquo;s not 100% sure, &ldquo;but I am interested in both the mechanical and chemical areas.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that Cavataio has a bright future and that with the education he&rsquo;s received from his elementary and high schools, he is well prepared for college and for a career. He said he's especially grateful for the time spent at The Grosse Pointe Academy, which for him began in the Early School.</p><p>&ldquo;The Academy definitely prepared me to be a leader,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because of the small class sizes at GPA, we had the opportunity to be in the limelight quite often and that gave me the confidence to pursue leadership opportunities in high school.&rdquo;</p><p>He stressed again how well prepared he was for most of his high school classes, including one called World Views and Civilizations&mdash;for which he said he benefited from the great exposure to world religions he received during GPA&rsquo;s Christian Life class&mdash;and his Chinese, math and physics classes at Cranbrook. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;My freshman year at Cranbrook was relatively easy for me since I was so far ahead academically,&rdquo; Cavataio said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that many other students from The Grosse Pointe Academy also end up in leadership positions at Cranbrook, ranging from class president to editor of the school newspaper.&rdquo;</p><p>Cavataio isn&rsquo;t the only one from his family who is benefiting from an Academy education. His brother, Piero, just graduated GPA this month and will be attending Cranbrook in the fall, and his sister, Gabriela, is currently at University Liggett&rsquo;s upper school. Another brother, Alessandro, will be in the 7th grade at GPA when school starts again.</p><p>One last followup question for Joseph involved plans he might have after he finishes his undergrad at U-M: &ldquo;I will either go to medical school or graduate school,&rdquo; he said without any hesitation.&nbsp;</p><p>And it is without any hesitation that we can say that the world is already in a much better place with Joseph Cavataio in it. It appears that its future will be in a better place as well.</p><div><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong>&nbsp;or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Early School teacher with deep Grosse Pointe Academy roots is right where she belongs, says&nbsp;</strong><strong>the most important part of her job is having a safe, secure, and welcoming classroom for her children.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150702091246.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up in the Pointes, GPA Early School teacher Peggy Varty (above, with husband, John) and her family were well aware of that big school building on Lake Shore Road.</p><p>Varty attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart through eighth grade when ASH occupied the campus and buildings now operated by GPA. Her two children attended GPA, a great aunt graduated from ASH in 1909 and her sister finished at ASH in 1967. But it was her brother, Bob, whose experience at Sacred Heart in its still-nascent Montessori program first convinced her of the value of the innovative teaching program founded in Europe in the early 1900s by Maria Montessori.&nbsp;</p><p>When Varty was a freshman in high school at St. Paul, her grandmother became quite ill and her mother was spending a lot of time at the hospital. Varty&rsquo;s mother called Mother Bayo, who was the principal of ASH at the time, to see if there was an opening at ASH&rsquo;s Montessori school for Varty&rsquo;s then four-year-old brother. Fortunately, Varty said, he was able to get into the school&rsquo;s afternoon session, which helped the situation at home quite a bit, but also made a profound impact on her little brother.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;In our family of five children, we were very impressed with what Bob was learning at Montessori and what he could do at such a young age,&rdquo; Varty said. &ldquo;None of us had gone to preschool, so it was a new experience for our family. When visitors would come over to the house, we would have Bob do all of his &lsquo;learning tricks&rsquo; and he was more than happy to show off his skills. He loved school and he loved learning.&rdquo;</p><p>What was interesting, said Varty, was that her brother&rsquo;s first teacher at ASH was from the Netherlands and did not even speak English. &ldquo;But in a Montessori classroom, especially for the younger students, you really don&rsquo;t need many verbal instructions,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And most Montessori teachers in the early &lsquo;60s received their training in Europe.&rdquo;</p><p>From those early days on, her brother&rsquo;s Montessori experience was always in the back of her mind, Varty said.</p><p>Varty recollects walking from St. Paul after school to pick up her little brother from ASH. &ldquo;The boys wore gray wool short-alls, white short-sleeve shirts with Peter Pan collars, gray knee socks and red tie oxford shoes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They looked adorable.&rdquo;</p><p>As an aside, Varty wants it known that her brother has been extremely successful in his life.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;And I attribute that success directly to his early experience in a Montessori school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bob has always been self-directed, focused, and up for any challenge, which I attribute to his Montessori beginnings.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Humanistic studies &lsquo;perfect major&rsquo; for Montessori teachers<br /></strong></p><p>When Varty went to college at St. Mary&rsquo;s in Notre Dame, Ind., she did not go to be a teacher. She was a humanistic studies major, which involves the study of literature, music, art and cultural history&mdash;from feudalism to present time. It&rsquo;s an interdisciplinary program that encourages students to think across traditional departmental lines.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150703152549.png" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;It was a fascinating major because it encompassed such a wide range of learning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We read the literature of that time, studied the art during that time frame, and by studying the history through the culture, it explained why certain events happened. In hindsight, it was the perfect major for a Montessori teacher since a Montessori teacher tries to develop the whole child and expose him or her to a wide, wide range of learning.&rdquo;</p><p>It was during her time in college that Varty became more fascinated with Montessori and even more so as she got closer to graduation. As a senior, she managed to get into an independent study program at a Montessori school in town where she worked three afternoons a week.</p><p>&ldquo;I loved it! I worked at the sound table and taught the children their sounds. Children love that one-on-one time and I loved helping the children learn their sounds and then learn to read.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When she graduated from college, Varty immediately took Montessori training and a year later she became a certified AMS Montessori teacher.</p><p>Varty pointed out, though, that Montessori teachers are not really called teachers. &ldquo;We are Montessori directresses,&rdquo; she said, with a smile.</p><p><strong>Full circle</strong></p><p>Soon after graduation from St. Mary&rsquo;s and right after she completed Montessori training, Varty got married. Her husband, John, worked in advertising and marketing, and his job took the couple across the country for a number of years.</p><p>But her Montessori training was never far from wherever she called home. She taught at schools in Cincinnati, Dayton and Kansas City, and even started a new Montessori school when she lived in Denver.</p><p>She took a break from teaching when her two children were young, but Varty eventually got back into education while living in Dove Canyon, California.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I taught art to grades K through six at four different public schools in southern California,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would travel to a different school each week. I did that for three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>When it looked like her family was moving back to Grosse Pointe, Varty contacted the principal of the Early School at GPA to find out about possible openings. Fortunately there was, she said, and in August of 1995, she came back home and began to teach Montessori at the Academy. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Since ASH was part of my childhood I already knew the layout of the campus and the buildings,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had fond memories of my time at ASH, so getting to GPA was like my life had come full circle. We were gone from Grosse Pointe for 23 years, so it was kind of ironic that when we came back to town, I was teaching at a school that I actually attended. And we bought a home two doors down from the home in which I grew up. My children went to GPA as well, so I got to experience the school again through their eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>Now heading into her 20th year at the Academy, Varty says without question, the most important part of her job is having a safe, secure, and welcoming classroom for her children.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The Early School is the child&rsquo;s first school experience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You want the child to have a positive experience so they will associate school with learning and fun, and nurturing is such an important aspect of working with small children. I actually relate well to three, four, and five year olds. I love to see the progress in their development from the time I meet them until they graduate from kindergarten. It is also fun to watch them mature into young adults when they get to the &lsquo;big school.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Barbara Isaacs,&nbsp;Academic Director, Montessori Centre International&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Early Education</strong></em>&nbsp;</p><p>(Find out more about the Academy's <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/239.html" target="_blank">Montessori program here</a></strong>.)</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150708112657.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Writing develops easily and spontaneously in a little child in the same way as speech. Reading on the other hand, forms part of an abstract intellectual culture. It interprets ideas represented by graphic symbols and is acquired later.&rdquo;</p><p>At first, many Montessori students are dubious about the statement above, taken from Maria Montessori&rsquo;s <em>The Discovery of the Child</em>. It does not mirror their own experiences learning to write, while much of the current research literature explores the difficulties young children experience when writing. They ask themselves: &ldquo;How is it possible and what does Montessori mean by this statement?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Identifying letter sounds</strong></p><p>During her work with children with special needs, Montessori observed that children with manual competence were able to reproduce letters with ease. She identified two types of skills required: an ability to link the sound of the letter to its physical shape, and to hold the writing implement. She focused on developing activities and materials that would enable young children to practice these skills, leading them to writing and reading competence. Montessori settings are well known for their multi-sensory approach to introducing children to phonic sounds using specially designed letters cut out of sandpaper and mounted on wood or card (blue for consonants and red for vowels). Practice in tracing the letter shapes and linking them with the sounds helps the children combine the phonic sounds of letters with their shape. It also guides them towards identifying the letter sound in words, focusing on the initial sounds before exploring those at the end and in the middle. This activity helps them in forming the letters when writing, and also with their initial reading when decoding c-v-c words and encountering blends in words.</p><p><strong>Fostering independence</strong></p><p>It is the physical skills essential for writing that are often overlooked and underestimated among early years practitioners. In the Montessori classroom there is an area called &lsquo;activities of everyday living,&rsquo; or &lsquo;practical life activities.&rsquo; Here there is much emphasis on &lsquo;preparation of the hand.&rsquo; We call this an indirect preparation, as the main focus is to foster children&rsquo;s independence while manipulating a range of everyday tools. While practicing to use tongs, scoops and tweezers, young children strengthen the muscles in their fingers and develop flexibility of the wrist. When threading and sewing, they develop eye-hand coordination and begin to understand the principles of needing to start in a particular place and follow a pattern. They practice how to hold the tip of the thread or a needle, focusing on the tripod grip. They also have an opportunity to use pegs, which further strengthen the thumb, index and middle finger.&nbsp;</p><p>At other times, children are encouraged to trace the insets of the puzzles with flat shapes included in the sensorial area &ndash; exploring with their index and middle fingers the straight and curved lines of triangles, circles and rectangular figures. They come to use the frames of these insets again when they practice with them as stencils, developing their lightness of touch and creating patterns of their choice. This is a more formal preparation for writing, and is preceded by many opportunities to mark-make in the creative area both inside and outside the classroom, when exploration of writing implements and mark-making tools is an essential prerequisite.</p><p><strong>Giving confidence</strong></p><p>This preparation and refinement of fine motor skills serves young children well when it comes to both writing and reading. The recognition of the letter sounds and shapes is the first step towards reading. The focus on indirect preparation of the hand gives them the confidence when writing and links the Montessori activities directly with the handwriting early learning goals.</p><p>The next challenge comes in encouraging nursery age children to want to put down their ideas, and in developing their understanding of the purpose of writing. Here the reading and writing are combined and represent the child&rsquo;s ability to share his/her ideas with others. This capacity to express oneself can be seen also as the foundation of being able to create writing. If we want to encourage this skill, we need to model it &ndash; adults using a pen and paper to make notes or shopping lists, write cards and messages to friends all demonstrate to children why writing is useful and encourage them to want to have a go.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150708113133.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p><strong>About the author:</strong>&nbsp;Barbara Isaacs trained with Montessori St. Nicholas (UK) in the early 1980s and since then continued to study both in the field of Montessori education and early years, achieving a master&rsquo;s in Early Years Education under the guidance of Tina Bruce in 2000.</p><p>She is the author of Bringing Montessori into Your Early Years Setting (2009) and Understanding the Montessori Approach (2012), both published by David Fulton Books.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past twenty five years, Isaacs trained and supported training of Montessori Teachers in her capacity of a lecturer both at Montessori St. Nicholas, London Montessori Centre and Montessori Centre International.

Montessori education recognizes that children learn in different ways, and accommodates all learning styles. Students are also free to learn at their own pace, each advancing through the curriculum as he is ready, guided by the teacher and an individualized learning plan.</p><p>Beginning at an early age, Montessori students develop order, coordination, concentration, and independence. Classroom design, materials, and daily routines support the individual&rsquo;s emerging &ldquo;self-regulation&rdquo; (ability to educate one&rsquo;s self, and to think about what one is learning), toddlers through adolescents.</p><p>Students are part of a close, caring community. The multi-age classroom&mdash;typically spanning 3 years&mdash;re-creates a family structure. Older students enjoy stature as mentors and role models; younger children feel supported and gain confidence about the challenges ahead. Teachers model respect, loving kindness, and a belief in peaceful conflict resolution.</p><p>Montessori students enjoy freedom within limits. Working within parameters set by their teachers, students are active participants in deciding what their focus of learning will be. Montessorians understand that internal satisfaction drives the child&rsquo;s curiosity and interest and results in joyous learning that is sustainable over a lifetime.</p><p>Students are supported in becoming active seekers of knowledge. Teachers provide environments where students have the freedom and the tools to pursue answers to their own questions.</p><p>Self-correction and self-assessment are an integral part of the Montessori classroom approach. As they mature, students learn to look critically at their work, and become adept at recognizing, correcting, and learning from their errors.</p><p>Given the freedom and support to question, to probe deeply, and to make connections, Montessori students become confident, enthusiastic, self-directed learners. They are able to think critically, work collaboratively, and act boldly&mdash;a skill set for the 21st century.</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong>&nbsp;or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150713150959.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p><p><strong>Nineteen-ninety-eight grad says climate change and sustainability are critical issues around the world.</strong></p><p><em>PHOTO CAPTIONS: For three photos at lower right: (top) GPA alum Katherine Ball (&rsquo;98) is in the halls of Congress at the end of her 2010 bike tour; (middle) kitchen sink greywater system; (bottom) a mycoboom placed by Ball as part of a series of ecological interventions aimed at filtering E. coli out of a lake in Indiana.</em></p><p><strong>Katherine Ball</strong>, who graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1998, is finishing up a year-long stint this August with the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship program in Copenhagen, Denmark, where she has been working with Danish authorities and community activists on sustainability initiatives in water and electricity.</p><p>Ball is one of only about 1,900 U.S. citizens who travel abroad each academic year through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. Recipients of Fulbright grants are selected on the basis of academic and professional achievement as well as demonstrated leadership potential. It&rsquo;s a prestigious honor to get a Fulbright and not just anyone gets one. To date, 53 Fulbright alumni from 12 countries have been awarded the Nobel Prize, and 82 more have received Pulitzer Prizes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150713151141.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>For Ball, however, it&rsquo;s not about the prestige. She says she wants to take what she&rsquo;s learned in Denmark, add a next move to troubled Greece to help out with its currently dire economy and then eventually come back to the states to work on water issues in California and Detroit.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Greece to work with a few different community groups there,&rdquo; Ball said. &ldquo;Since the economic situation is so bad due to the troika's financial coercion, a lot of people are coming up with alternatives out of necessity &ndash; different ways of making a living and working together cooperatively. I want to go to Greece to learn from people there, interview them and write another short book about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Coming back to the states to apply what she&rsquo;s learned in Europe will undoubtedly give Ball a head start in tackling what conceivably could be&mdash;and for many, it already is&mdash;the next great crisis bearing down on America: climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>But she won&rsquo;t be starting fresh in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cycling for solutions</strong></p><p>In 2010, Ball and three cohorts bicycled across the United State to learn more about the climate crisis and its possible solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;3,094 miles, 91 days, 13 states, 21 communities, four bicyclists, one support car driver, and 45 solutions to the climate crisis,&rdquo; she wrote on a blog after completing the trip, which was dubbed &ldquo;the Solutions Revolution.&rdquo; Ball and friends biked from Portland, Oregon, to Washington D.C., after which they took a train to Florida and then sailed across the Gulf of Mexico to attend a United Nations Climate Change Conference that was held in Cancun, Mexico, that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Her cycling trip included stops at Montana State University, where she met with a mycologist who talked about his discovery of gliocadium roseum, an endophytic fungus that produces biofuel, and with a local furniture maker in Idaho who powers his hand-built, off-the-grid home and workshop with a micro-hydropower system propelled by a local creek.</p><p>But it was a stop in her hometown of Detroit that opened Ball&rsquo;s eyes to how creative some people can be when it comes to sustainability solutions and environmental consciousness.</p><p>&ldquo;In downtown Detroit, we visited the Catherine Ferguson Academy, a public school for pregnant teens and preteens,&rdquo; Ball said. &ldquo;When a science teacher there discovered that formaldehyde in their dissection animals is harmful to pregnant women, he realized he needed to find another way for students to receive an equal educational experience without the toxins. So he and the students started a farm in the lots behind the school&mdash;complete with a red barn, chickens, geese, goats, orchards, vegetable plots, bees, and even a horse.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to the students growing and selling produce for Detroit residents, Ball said they use the farm as a laboratory, so whenever an animal dies, the whole school gathers to dissect it to discover the cause of death.&nbsp;</p><p>Ball&rsquo;s bicycle trip ended with a busy few days in Washington, D.C., where she and her colleagues met with 20 different legislative offices to talk about their concerns.</p><p><strong>From GPA to Greece</strong></p><p>Even though her educational journeys thus far have been all over the country and in many parts of the world, Ball credits The Grosse Pointe Academy and its teachers and staff with giving her a great academic beginning. After the Academy, and after she graduated from Grosse Pointe South High School, she matriculated at the University of Wisconsin, where she received a BS degree in art, and where she also used a university greenhouse to experiment with growing plants for live use in her sculptures. She then attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and finally, to Portland State University, where she earned an MFA in art and social practice.</p><p>Ball will tell you, however, that it&rsquo;s getting out and talking to people and finding out about their needs that is the most important part of her ongoing education.</p><p>&ldquo;My Fulbright research focused on the infrastructure of the country of Denmark,&rdquo; Ball said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been conducting lots of interviews with people who help make the electricity, clean the water, plan roads and bike paths, and organize community centers. I'm transcribing all the interviews into a short book and since my Fulbright is associated with the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, I have access to their printing equipment and can print the book there. This spring, I had a book debut at the LA Art Book Fair and in the fall, it will be at the New York Book Fair. It's a collection of oral histories of people living in the Mojave Desert. Hopefully the book I print in Copenhagen will take a similar trajectory to that one.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>After she gets to Greece in the fall, Ball hopes also to spend more time in Germany and Paris to learn more and to &ldquo;make more art.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have some invitations to do different art projects in Cologne, Hamburg, and Paris, she said. &ldquo;Eventually, I would like to come back to the U.S. to work on water issues in California and Detroit. I've made a few sculptures that organically redesign kitchen and bathroom sinks. I think these designs could be helpful in areas where there are water shortages or water shutoffs. The &lsquo;sculptural sinks&rsquo; function just like normal sinks except they use rainwater collected from rooftops.&rdquo;</p><p>And, she said, rather than connecting to the sewer system, her sculptural sinks use mushrooms to clean the wastewater and plants to consume the wastewater and transpire it into the air &ndash; &ldquo;thereby returning it to the hydrologic cycle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It all sounds extremely intriguing, and if all goes according to Ball&rsquo;s ideas and plans, despite a sometimes bleak forecast, it looks like there is much to be optimistic about for the future of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong>&nbsp;or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150720094404.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On this day, July 20, in 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong set foot on the surface of the moon, making him the first human to do so. The 240,000 mile flight he took, alongside fellow astronauts Edwin Aldrin Jr. and Michael Collins, was the culmination of a NASA space program Apollo program that involved an estimated 400,000 engineers, technicians, and scientists, and costing $24 billion (close to $100 billion in today&rsquo;s dollars). &nbsp;</p><p>For Grosse Pointe Academy middle-school students in GPA teacher Robert Rochte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Near-Space Explorations&rdquo; R.E.A.L. class, a flight they were involved in this past January worked out to be considerably less expensive and lengthy. But it nonetheless proved to be just as spectacular for those students as a high-altitude balloon they launched from the school yard ended up landing more than 500 miles from the school&rsquo;s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.</p><p>&quot;All of our predictions suggested it would land somewhere in northwestern Ohio,&quot; Rochte said.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150720095536.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>But the 30-foot balloon filled with helium and equipped with a payload box containing a GPS tracker, which unfortunately malfunctioned, and a mini digital camcorder ended up in a field in Shawsville, Virginia, 500 miles from Grosse Pointe Farms. It eventually made its way to a middle school in Shawsville where students there connected with the Academy student &quot;engineers&quot; in an exciting and informative video teleconference.</p><p>&quot;We never dreamed it would somehow make it all the way to Virginia,&rdquo; Rochte said. &quot;The call from the Virginia school on Friday morning was the talk of the Academy all day.&quot;</p><p>One early speculation for the balloon's unexpected voyage is that the helium diffusion rate was not as high as expected, and with some left-over gas in the balloon, the descent was extremely slow. According to Rochte, who teaches mathematics and computer science in addition to the Near Space Explorations elective class, this would have allowed the balloon to travel much farther with the jet stream.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Our farthest ever GPA balloon flight was 933 miles, back in March of 2007. That one almost landed in the Atlantic,&quot; Rochte said.</p><p>The event also garnered plenty of media coverage as Detroit-area news outlets and some in Virginia filed reports on the flight. . .</p><div><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4lgHsdDALY" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">WXYZ-TV Channel 7</span></strong></a></p><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><a href="http://www.wset.com/clip/11122994/mysterious-object-lands-in-montgomery-county-connects-classrooms" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">WSET, ABC Affiliate</span></strong></a></p><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><a href="http://www.wsls.com/story/28070901/balloon-from-michigan-lands-in-shawsville" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">WSLS, NBC Affiliate</span></strong></a></p><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Helvetica, Arial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/education/montgomery_county/michigan-school-s-balloon-floats-miles-to-shawsville/article_75a10212-121d-5cd5-a70e-1a43f94d931e.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Roanoke Times (front page story)</span></strong></a></p></div><p><strong>About R.E.A.L. classes at The Grosse Pointe Academy:&nbsp;</strong>Real-world Experiences and Applied Learning (R.E.A.L.) classes focused on critical thinking and problem-solving activities that required students to propose and create a solution for a real-world problem.

So says a recent report published by the <strong><a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/" target="_blank">National Academy of Sciences</a></strong>, a private, nongovernmental institution established by the U.S Congress to advise the nation on issues related to science and technology.</p><p>These schools have integrated engineering instruction not only with the other STEM subjects (science, technology, and mathematics), but also with many other subjects, including art, writing, and&nbsp;literature.</p><p>At The Grosse Pointe Academy, they call that &ldquo;STEAM,&rdquo; and it has been a well-established part of the GPA curriculum for some time. Along with cutting-edge technology in every classroom, the integration of the arts has been implemented across the entire spectrum of courses, giving all GPA students a continuum of instruction.</p><p>In the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;STEM (or STEAM) Lab,&quot; teachers are turning Academy students into makers, inventors, engineers, and dreamers. Student experiences in GPA&rsquo;s &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; Innovation &amp; Design Center include LEGO Robotics, 3D printing and challenging STEM activities.&nbsp;</p><p>And two years ago, a new electives program for middle school students was set into motion at the Academy. Called Real-world Experiences and Applied Learning (R.E.A.L.), these classes focus on critical thinking and problem-solving activities that require students to propose and create a solution for a real-world problem. Classes have included App Design, Video Production, CSI and Marketing Program Design among new ones added annually.</p><p>Find out more about The Grosse Pointe Academy&rsquo;s innovative&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/0.html" target="_blank">curriculum offerings here</a></strong>, beginning with its Montessori Early School program.</p><p>Read the full report on &ldquo;Engineering in K-12 Education&rdquo; published by the National Academy of Sciences (National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council) <strong><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Feder/publication/228524111_Engineering_in_K-12_education_Understanding_the_status_and_improving_the_prospects/links/544100b70cf2a76a3cc63363.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current parents discuss decision to enroll their children at the Academy&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Parents worry about many things&mdash;with education being high on the list. These worries cause lost sleep and spark countless discussions wondering if their chosen school will prepare their children to compete in a future world not yet fully understood. &nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, parents find a way to calm their worries about education by thinking: &ldquo;We seem to be doing enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our children are good kids.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our school is fine.&rdquo; &ldquo;I like their teachers.&rdquo; &ldquo;We went to a similar school and turned out okay; our children will, too.&rdquo; After all, the public schools in the Pointes and in many of the surrounding communities have great reputations and turn out many successful young men and women.</p><p>But Fred and Pam Rollins wanted more certainty that their children would develop a strong passion for learning, have meaningful choices beyond middle school learning and expand the skills they will need to compete.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150921152951.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;As parents, we believe our role is to guide and shape our children,&rdquo; Fred Rollins said. &ldquo;And you want them to achieve their highest potential and have choices when it comes to high schools and colleges. You want your own actions to cumulatively add to the development of your child and not make up for what you feel is missing in their education.&rdquo;</p><p>So when it came to making a decision on schools for their two children, the Rollins did their homework. They had heard about The Grosse Pointe Academy and remembered vaguely seeing the distinguished-looking building off of Lake Shore Road after moving to Grosse Pointe in 1999 from out of state.</p><p>At the time, we did not have any children,&rdquo; Pam Rollins said. &ldquo;We moved to St. Clair, Michigan, lived there for 14 years and then had two children, a girl and a boy, who we enrolled in a school in our area.&rdquo;</p><p>But when the Rollins kids were finishing up second grade and kindergarten, Pam and Fred decided they wanted more from their children&rsquo;s school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Long commute worth every mile</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We began to think about other options and focused more on the type of school we wanted rather than the location of the school,&rdquo; Fred said. They remembered the lakeside school from their days in Grosse Pointe and decided to check out the Academy&rsquo;s website, which piqued their interest even more.&nbsp;</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t until they visited the dignified-looking school building that Pam and Fred became more than just interested.</p><p>&ldquo;We met with the Academy&rsquo;s then-admissions director, Molly McDermott, and took a tour of the school,&rdquo; Pam said. &ldquo;We absolutely loved what we saw. Then our kids visited the school and went through the admissions process, and we were all introduced to some of the fabulous teachers in the lower school.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The Rollins said that through the years they had done many thorough interviews with other schools, so they had a good idea of what they were looking for. Apparently they found it on 171 Lake Shore Road because they enrolled their children for the following school year. For awhile, Pam and her husband commuted with their kids the 45 miles each way from St. Clair to the Academy before eventually moving back to the Pointes.</p><p>&ldquo;It might be different than how these things usually go, but we were drawn to the school first and then decided we wanted to be in the community full time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are very pleased with our decision and happy to be part of the Academy family.&rdquo;</p><p>Rollins said her children&mdash;now fully matriculated at the Academy: Alexandra is in the sixth grade, Jack is in fourth&mdash;are doing extremely well.</p><p>&ldquo;We were impressed with the school when our kids first started here,&rdquo; Fred said. &ldquo;But since then we&rsquo;ve really discovered what the true value of a Grosse Pointe Academy education is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It boils down to knowing that your children are getting the right foundation to prepare them for what the world has to offer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell. We landed at the Academy to give our children the right supportive environment for them to take risks, push harder and try new things. We wanted to give them this chance before high school when it may not be as easy to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>The future</strong></p><p>Fred and Pam Rollins, like all parents, don&rsquo;t really know what the future holds for their still-young children. But they both are sure they&rsquo;ve given them a good start by bringing them to the Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are extremely confident that the Grosse Pointe Academy&mdash;with its nurturing environment, its great teachers, curriculum, culture and resources&mdash;is preparing them to achieve their fullest potential.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>While a school can&rsquo;t eliminate every sleepless night as a parent, Pam said, the right choice can offer a peace of mind in your children&rsquo;s education.</p><p>&ldquo;We truly believe we have given Alex and Jack the opportunity to go further in their young lives than we thought was possible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We know that when they leave the Academy, they will take with them the academics and life skills necessary to succeed in high school and then ultimately to thrive in a world that gets more complicated every day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><div><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150520171932.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the last few decades, internationalism in education has been in particular focus for institutions of learning in America.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 15 years ago, <em>Change</em> magazine published an article by Philip G. Altbach and Patti McGill Peterson entitled &ldquo;Internationalize American higher education? Not exactly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The article discussed the fact that while American colleges and universities &ldquo;talked&rdquo; of giving students a more global approach in the classroom, few actually &ldquo;walked&rdquo; it. And while Altbach and Peterson were looking at higher education in their study, it is clear that elementary and secondary education in the United States also has been giving students too few tools to compete in a shrinking world&mdash;even considering the major inroads made lately in this country by the International Baccalaureate.</p><p>That is why it&rsquo;s well worth noting that since 1969 when it was established as an independent coeducational day school, the Grosse Pointe Academy has emphasized a global approach to classroom curricula and to its faculty.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with a rigorous core academic program that includes mathematics, social studies, science and technology, Academy students experience three years of foreign-language study with choices that include Chinese, Spanish and French. In fact, GPA students regularly earn high marks in an extremely competitive national French exam sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of French (AATF). Further, students as young as 2-1/2 years old to those in grade 8 at GPA are regularly exposed to languages and cultures from around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s the first grade&rsquo;s &ldquo;creative movement&rdquo; interpretation of European artist Henri Matisse or the recent exploration of Chinese dining culture by middle school students, it is safe to say that students at the Grosse Pointe Academy spend literally every day immersed in some form of global learning or experience.</p><p><strong>Grosse Pointe by way of Belgium and Ivory Coast</strong></p><p>The teaching staff at the Academy also earns high marks when it comes to &ldquo;internationalism.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Witness Cindy&nbsp;Mayilukila&nbsp;of GPA&rsquo;s Montessori Early School.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayilukila is an American citizen by virtue of her birth in New York City. But her early life experience skews decidedly offshore.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150520172329.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p>When she was only a few months old, her family moved from New York to Belgium where they lived for several years, which probably explains why French is her first language. But then she and her family moved to Africa and lived in Ivory Coast, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo for a number of years while frequently traveling back and forth to Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayilukila&nbsp;said that as she was growing up and going through school, she always thought that for a professional career, she&rsquo;d love to be a professional translator, which would allow her to utilize her native cultural language of French and African dialects. &ldquo;But after becoming a mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I realized that teaching was becoming part of my heart and I knew that&rsquo;s where I really belonged.&rdquo;</p><p>Mayilukila has been part of GPA&rsquo;s academic staff only since 2013. But her background in progressive education goes back much further.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Prior to coming to GPA, I worked as a lead teacher for three years at the Schoolhouse Montessori Academy in Troy,&rdquo; she said. Before that, she said she worked in two other schools, Montessori Children's Academy in Saint Clair, Mich., and Montessori Stepping Stones in Mt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150918161938.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When contacted one day ahead of her book launch on September 15, Grosse Pointe Academy grad, former teacher and now author, H.S. Cross, a.k.a, Heather Cross, was looking forward with nervous anticipation to the event, which was being held at Bookcourt in New York City, her adopted hometown.</p><p>She had little to worry about, though, as it turned out very well indeed, with a standing-room-only crowd that completely emptied Bookcourt&rsquo;s stock of &ldquo;Wilberforce,&rdquo; the first book by this Harvard-educated writer.&nbsp;</p><p>Before and since its debut in Brooklyn, this novel about an angst-ridden and restless young man growing up in a private English boarding school in the 1920s has been gathering numerous positive responses from many in the literati set:&nbsp;</p><p>Wilberforce is one of &ldquo;an embarrassment of literary riches,&rdquo; &ldquo;33 can&rsquo;t miss new reads for the fall.&rdquo; &mdash; Huffington Post</p><p>&ldquo;a multilayered drama&rdquo; &mdash; Publishers Weekly</p><p>&ldquo;. . . ambitious and accomplished debut . . .&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;This convincingly handled work is recommended for all fans of coming-of-age novels.&rdquo; &mdash; Library Journal</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150918162521.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;Stylishly inventive, H. S. Cross has crafted an imaginative, ritualistic world of men and boys narrowly confined by tradition and authority,&rdquo; says the book&rsquo;s publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. &ldquo;Wilberforce is an indelible portrait of a young man caught between lust and cruelty, grief and God, frustrated love and abject longing-and a tour de force that heralds the arrival of a brilliant new novelist.&rdquo;</p><p>Now working on her second book&mdash;something of a sequel to Wilberforce, Heather Cross says&mdash;it&rsquo;s very clear that she is now doing what she&rsquo;s always wanted to do&mdash;ever since &ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s second grade class&rdquo; at GPA when she wrote her first &ldquo;story.&rdquo; (see below)</p><p>In the following interview with The Grosse Pointe Academy, Cross discusses her debut novel, her university, a teaching career at some of New York&rsquo;s finest private schools, and, of course, her formative years at the Academy.</p><p><strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy: </strong>You graduated from the Academy in 1982. Did you start in preschool in the Early School? Any siblings also attend?</p><p><strong>Heather Cross:</strong> Yes, I started Early School on my third birthday! My younger brother and sister also attended from Early School. Miss Viviano was my first and probably greatest teacher. Many times I&rsquo;ve thought back to those half-days in her classroom and see them as a model for perfect, safe, absorbed concentration. I channel that state all the time when I&rsquo;m writing.</p><p><strong>GPA: I</strong>n which of the Grosse Pointes did you live while attending GPA? Which high school did you attend after GPA?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> We lived in Grosse Pointe Farms, and my brother and I went to Grosse Pointe South until my family moved to New York the summer before my 12th grade.</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>Where did you attend college?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>HC:</strong> I have a BA from Harvard in history and literature.</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>I see from your bio that you taught at Friends Seminary in New York City. Do you still teach there and what did (do) you teach? Have you taught anywhere else, or have you worked in any other jobs since Harvard?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HC: </strong>When I left college, I was working in the theater. I did several internships in directing and dramaturgy, and at one point I worked for a literary agent, but eventually I fell away from the theater and started teaching. My first assignment was subbing for the woman who had taught me AP French. I worked at Friends for ten years but eventually left because I needed more time for writing. At Friends I taught all up and down the school (grades 2-12) in a variety of subjects, but settled down to 5th and 6th grade English and history. While there, I wrote a series of grammar books called The Gray Grammarian (levels 1, 2 and 3) for my students. (Thank you, Miss Fetterman!) I&rsquo;ve done some shorter-term teaching at other NYC private schools, in particular, St. Thomas Choir School. Now I tutor middle- and high-school students when I&rsquo;m not writing.</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>Always want to be a teacher? Writer?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Well, starting with writing, when I was growing up, theater was my &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; and I could tell that other people were much better writers than I was. I loved reading and was always making up stories in my head, but I had slow handwriting and was a poor speller, so writing seemed beyond me. The sense of impossibility was made worse by the fact that I imagined complicated book-length sagas rather than short stories. Sometimes I&rsquo;d fill half a notebook and then realize I&rsquo;d only narrated the very beginning of the story. It wasn&rsquo;t until late high school or college that writing got serious for me.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as teaching, [as a youngster] I used to play school with my dolls, and at a certain point I sensed that I&rsquo;d probably teach somewhere along the line. I never thought of myself as a career teacher, though, probably because I had these other competing ambitions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>Maybe it&rsquo;s wrong to assume that some of your inspiration for Wilberforce was gained from teaching at Friends Seminary or perhaps attending GPA, so if it&rsquo;s in fact an incorrect assumption, what actually did inspire you to write your first novel about a private British school set in the late 1920s? &nbsp;</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> My infatuation with the world of English boys&rsquo; schools came upon me when I was 16. I was flipping channels on one of those old-knob cable boxes, and I stumbled onto an episode of Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s Stalky &amp; Co, as dramatized by the BBC. Stalky is a collection of stories inspired by Kipling&rsquo;s own school days, and in most respects, it was incomprehensible&mdash;yet, at the same time, utterly compelling to me. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I had the book checked out of the Grosse Pointe Public Library, and so began a long romance with the English school story.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends Seminary is where I learned to be a teacher and thus became the kind of person who could write from a teacher&rsquo;s point of view. As far as the GPA is concerned, I think there was something formative about going to school in those beautiful neo-gothic buildings where I absorbed a sense of history, mystery and faith.</p><p>By the way, the school in Wilberforce is called St. Stephen&rsquo;s Academy. In the years I was imagining this place way before I began writing Wilberforce, I experimented with a lot of names. It would have been more traditional, in terms of the English boarding school, to call it Something School or Something College. I wound up with an Academy, which in the book they often refer to as &ldquo;the Academy.&quot; Maybe you can also guess the first street I lived on in Grosse Pointe Farms.</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>Can you share any memories from your time at The Grosse Pointe Academy?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> Way too many to mention! But if you want to see a story I wrote at the GPA in Miss O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s second grade class, you can read <strong><a href="http://www.fsgbookkeeping.com/book-keeping-with-h-s-cross/" target="_blank">this piece on [my publisher] FSG&rsquo;s Book Keeping blog</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>GPA: </strong>What about your second book?</p><p><strong>HC:</strong> I have a lot of material in my head that revolves around St. Stephen&rsquo;s Academy, so I&rsquo;m working on another book that&rsquo;s set there.</p><p>One more thing: It might be obvious from the press you have seen, but this novel is adult literary fiction. Although it&rsquo;s set at a boys&rsquo; boarding school, it&rsquo;s definitely not for children&mdash;in style or in content.</p><p><strong>GPA:&nbsp;</strong>Finally, just a little housekeeping. Where in New York City do you live?</p><p><strong>HC:&nbsp;</strong>It&rsquo;s such a cliche, but I live in Brooklyn. I don&rsquo;t put that in my bio, though, because I&rsquo;m so tired of reading about writers who live in Brooklyn. Evidently, it&rsquo;s a requirement!&nbsp;</p><div><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

Our classrooms have a Practical Life area, where children develop fine motor skills through a care for their environment, Sensorial area, where children learn color, size, texture, and weight through their work, in addition to academic materials in language arts, math, science, and social studies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Universal accolades</strong></p><p>Experts worldwide also are in agreement that the Montessori environment builds independence and perseverance, while fostering creativity and critical thinking skills. In fact, Montessori has produced some of the greatest entrepreneurs of the day, with the founders of Google, Amazon, and Wikipedia all having attended Montessori schools.</p><p>Author and education innovator <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Denning/e/B001IOH2NU" target="_blank">Steve Denning</a></strong>&nbsp;said the Montessori approach has spawned a genuine creative elite, including Google&rsquo;s founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin, Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos, videogame pioneer Will Wright, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, cook Julia Child and rapper Sean &ldquo;P.Diddy&rdquo; Combs.</p><p>&ldquo;The Montessori learning method establishes a collaborative environment without grades or tests, multi-aged classrooms, as well as self-directed learning and discovery for long blocks of time,&rdquo; Denning said. &ldquo;These methods go against the grain of traditional educational methods, but they have uncanny parallels in the success of their alumni.</p><p>Google, he said, wasn&rsquo;t launched by Larry Page and Sergei Brin as a brilliant vision, but rather as a project to improve library searches, followed by a series of small discoveries that unlocked a revolutionary business model. He said the Amazon strategy used by Jeff Bezos involved developing ideas in new markets similar to &ldquo;planting seeds&rdquo; or &ldquo;going down blind alleys.&rdquo; Amazon&rsquo;s executives learn and uncover opportunities as they go, with many dead ends but also sometimes a huge, broad avenue, according to Denning.</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, including Montessori, please fill out our <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong> or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146.

Musicians, artists and other creative luminaries, including Thom York, Patti Smith, Bill McKibben, Flea, Rebecca Foon and Dhani Harrison, are planning to gather in Paris, France, on Dec. 4 and 5 to perform as the culmination of “Pathway to Paris,” a special year-plus long initiative designed to raise awareness about climate change. The event will coincide with the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which is scheduled to take place Nov. 30 through Dec. 11, also in Paris.

Among the artists performing in December and one of the chief architects of the event is Jesse Paris Smith, who is Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee <strong>Patti Smith</strong>’s daughter and who also at one time plied the hallways and classrooms as a student of The Grosse Pointe Academy along with her older brother, Jackson.

Jesse and Jackson Smith attended the Academy while living in nearby St. Clair Shores with their mother, Patti, and father, the late <strong><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fred-sonic-smith-mn0000176087" target="_blank">MC5 musician Fred “Sonic” Smith</a></strong>. A year or so after Fred Smith’s untimely death in 1994 due to heart failure, Patti and her family moved back to New York City, where Patti still lives and where her two kids split much of their time with Detroit.

According to Jesse Smith, the Pathway to Paris initiative, which was founded in September of 2014, has been bringing together musicians/artists/poets/writers with scientists/climate experts/politicians/activists in a dialogue about climate change leading up to the UN conference (Cop21) in Paris.

“We want to highlight the opportunity the conference brings to establish an ambitious, legally binding global climate agreement,” Smith said. “Our main partner is <strong><a href="http://350.org" target="_blank">350.org</a></strong>, which is a leading climate-action organization founded by Bill Mckibben, and all of our events serve as fundraisers for 350. Our final events, which will serve as fundraisers for 350, are in Paris on December 4 and 5, the first weekend of the UN conference.”

Jesse's brother, Jackson, a versatile musician, lives in the Detroit area and spends much of his musical "chops" with the band, the Orbitsuns, a honky-tonk, rock and roll band based in southeast Michigan. He started playing in Detroit with Brit-pop band Fletcher Pratt, and since then he’s played locally with Back in Spades, The Paybacks, jazz singer Linda Blanke and the Skeemin’ No Goods on occasion.

Jackson notably accompanied his mother on her goosebump-inducing rendition of the song "Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You" at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/another-day-another-time-celebrating/id820662909" target="_blank">"Another Day, Another Time: Celebrating The Music Of 'Inside Llewyn Davis'" concert</a> held a couple of years ago at Manhattan's Town Hall. He’s also toured with Elton John, Leon Russell, Greg Allman and several other artists.

Jackson has appeared on many records, which range from local bands like the Dead Bodies and the Farwells all the way to larger national acts like the Electric Six and Wanda Jackson as well as a Steve Earle record. In addition, Jackson appeared a few years ago on a Jeff Bridges record.

Jesse Paris Smith is a composer and multi-instrumentalist who has performed globally in many configurations, collaborating with other musicians and artists, including Soundwalk Collective, Tenzin Choegyal, <a href="http://www.treelaboratory.com" target="_blank">Tree Laboratory</a>, Shyam Nepali, along with her mother and brother. She also performs in a band called Belle Ghoul, which includes Smith and five other Detroit musicians, and has performed with Esquire, Kenny Tudrick and Skinny Wrists. Her compositions have been commissioned for films, commercials, art installations, audiobooks and live film score performances. She is a graduate of the Sound and Music Institute of New York City.

Now 28, Jesse is passionate about her work as a musician, but it’s her work with climate change and Pathway to Paris that really gets her energized. That was made abundantly clear after she agreed to be interviewed for this article by The Grosse Pointe Academy, which, by the way, also was clearly influential in her young life.

______________________________________________

<strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy: First of all, Jesse, even though you were fairly young when you moved to New York and left GPA, what are some of your specific memories of the school? </strong>

<strong>Jesse Paris Smith: </strong>I loved attending GPA so much, and of all the memories of my life, the ones of being there are some of the most dear to me. While I was only a student at the school for four years total, what I learned and experienced there created such an important foundation for the years that followed, and so many things I learned have stayed with me, and have probably influenced me in ways I’m not even aware of. This includes what I learned in the classroom, interacting with the other students, and just being in those incredible buildings, and on the grounds of the school.

I still have dreams about that place, and can remember every room there so clearly just as it was back then. I remember all of my teachers and hundreds of experiences. I remember the games we played and songs we learned at the Early School, staying behind after hours to get extra lessons in tying my shoes, being introduced to clay and painting. I remember so many songs we learned with Mrs. Chrisner, and can still recite the 50 states in alphabetical order. I remember the taxidermy animals in the science classroom and going on nature excursions on the school grounds with Mr. Fultz. Field Day!! Recess! The school store. Ordering books from the Scholastic book orders. Watching School House Rock. Uniforms. Picture Day. Using a computer for the first time, learning how to type, and playing Oregon Trail. Mrs. Vitolins teaching us to count to 100 in French, how to sing the days of the week in a song, and learning about special French holidays and celebrations. All of the teachers I had were so creative. They incorporated traditional educational modalities with their own unique brands of teaching, methods that made things fun, but also left us with long-lasting knowledge. I loved the lunch room and spending time with the other kids. The chaotic moments of taking off our snow covered boots and snow pants in the downstairs locker room. The special and fun ways we celebrated holidays there. Coming to school in Halloween costumes and exchanging Valentine’s Day cards. The Christmas program!!

Going to Chapel was very special to me, and I can still remember the feeling and smell in there so clearly. Driving to and from school every morning and afternoon on the bus with Mrs. Bartz. This is such an important memory. That was such a special experience like a secret society, and a whole other family. She treated us so well, and taught us so many important lessons. I loved waking up every morning and going on the bus with my brother, and meeting him back there after school. I have so many great memories of my brother at GPA. I have also been envious of him at times for going to GPA all the way through and being a real alum! Mrs. Kelly was my first grade teacher and was so dear to my whole family. When my dad passed away she came to the memorial service, and I remember that so clearly as a memory of learning that teachers were real people outside of the school environment.  I was in 2nd grade when my dad passed away, and when I came back to school, all of my classmates had made me a special card with their condolences written with pictures and signatures. It was so kind and innocent, and I wish I still had it. We moved to NYC a year or so after he passed away and a week before I turned 9 years old.

<strong>GPA: Did you live in the Grosse Pointes then, or was it always St. Clair Shores?</strong>

<strong>JPS:</strong> I was born in Detroit at St. John’s Hospital, and came home to a house in St. Clair Shores, and that is the only place I lived in Michigan at that time.

<center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151015141025.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></center><strong>GPA: Can you talk about your work with </strong><a href="http://www.pathwaytoparis.com " target="_blank"><strong>Pathway to Paris</strong></a><strong> and why you have become so involved with the climate-change issue?</strong>

<strong>JPS: </strong>I first became passionate about climate change when I was in high school in NYC. During and after high school, I volunteered and worked for many environmental organizations, and did a lot of grassroots activism. I had wanted to become a climate scientist, and devote my life to studying glaciers, and working towards finding real solutions for climate change. While I have ended up so far on a path more focused on music and the arts, I am still very passionate about this issue and wanting to find and create ways to connect the worlds of the arts and sciences, especially focused on the climate issue.

When the People’s Climate March took place in NYC in September 2014, I contacted a fellow musician friend who I knew was active in creating sustainable environments and finding effective solutions for environmental problems. We put together a concert very quickly, which also served as a fundraiser for <strong><a href="http://350.org" target="_blank">350.org</a></strong>, and the response was amazing. We were also so delighted to be able to have Bill McKibben speak at the beginning of our event, which was live streamed all over the world. We decided to continue with this concert platform, turning it into a full series leading up to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris in December, hence the name, ‘<strong><a href="http://www.pathwaytoparis.com " target="_blank">Pathway to Paris</a></strong>.’ We’ve since partnered with Bill McKibben and <strong><a href="http://350.org" target="_blank">350.org</a></strong>, which has been a dream come true. We have a few more events leading up to our final concert in Paris, and will also attend the conference.

<strong>GPA: Is there a core group of musicians and artists who are as passionate as you are about this issue?</strong>

<strong>JPS: </strong>We have certainly met some incredible musicians, poets, artists, actors, speakers, activists, writers, etc., who are passionate, informed, and well spoken about the issue of climate change. We’ve also been happy to find people in our own circles who share this concern with us. And of course, there are others who have that fire in them, and view climate change as a definite problem, even though they might not necessarily be active in fighting it, or be well-versed in speaking about the science or politics of it. There is such a wide range, and no matter what level people are at with it, we are working to bring everyone together with the understanding that this is a global issue that concerns every person, every single day, and requires immediate action.

The issue of climate change is so massive, and can be extremely daunting, overwhelming, and even scary to think about, but Pathway to Paris has shown us that just two people working together can create something bigger than they ever dreamed. Even just that in itself is an encouraging lesson to remember.

<strong>GPA: Are you still adding artists to perform in Paris on December 4?</strong>

<strong>JPS: </strong>We are pleased with the response of performers and speakers wanting to take part, and are open to bringing in more artists if it feels like the right fit. It would be wonderful to have more cultures of the world represented on the stage, as this is a global issue that hopefully in December will unite all the nations to work together in establishing a legally binding agreement. So while we only have a limited time on the stage, ideally it would be amazing to have performers from other cultural backgrounds, representing many countries from all corners of the world. Climate change is a global problem that concerns us all, and music is a way to bridge the geographical borders and bring people closer together.

<strong>GPA: Can you talk about your involvement with </strong><a href="http://www.everestawakening.com" target="_blank"><strong>Everest Awakening </strong></a><strong>and how successful it has been in raising both awareness and money for victims and survivors of the Nepal earthquakes last spring?</strong>

<strong>JPS:</strong> The Himalayan region of the world is very special and dear to my heart. I was first introduced to Tibetan culture in Ann Arbor when my mom brought me to Jewel Heart and we met Gelek Rimpoche. It was shortly after my dad passed away, and I remember everyone at Jewel Heart being so kind, warm and welcoming to us. When we moved to NYC, my mom started to perform each year at the <strong><a href="http://www.tibethouse.us" target="_blank">Tibet House U.S.</a></strong> annual benefit concert at Carnegie Hall, and I would always attend. When I was 16, I began performing at the concert, as well. For a few years now, I’ve been on the Associate Board at Tibet House, and also help to run a monthly event series at the Himalayan art museum here in NYC, called the Rubin Museum of Art. One of my closest friends and collaborators is a Tibetan singer and musician, and I have many other Tibetan and Nepalese friends and collaborators here in NYC, as well. So since I had been exposed to and interested in the Himalayan cultures for so long, I really wanted to visit that part of the world. In January, I went to Nepal, and it was definitely one of the most important experiences of my life. When the earthquake happened only a few months later, there was no question in my mind but to take immediate action in any way I knew how.

The outpouring of help from fellow musicians, artists, activists, and people of all walks of life was amazing. Even though it was under such tragic circumstances, I also got to meet so many beautiful musicians, artists and activists who are now dear friends and collaborators. The money we raised through <a href="http://www.everestawakening.com" target="_blank">the music website and concerts was sent to trusted organizations and foundations</a> of friends working on the ground there in Nepal and Tibet. It has been amazing to see this activism from other musician friends, as well, some of them working here in NYC, so far from their villages in Nepal, playing so many concerts and raising funds when they just wanted to be with their families so much. And of course I am so in awe of my friends who so quickly flew there to volunteer on the ground, and have continued to go back and forth, bringing funds, supplies, volunteering in schools, and rebuilding a better and stronger Nepal.

I hope that people continue to put their focus on that region of the planet, as it so fully represents so many extremes of life, and is such a beautiful land that continues to require our attention. The economic, political, environmental, and social problems were there before the earthquake, and remain today. And of course it is one of the most powerful and beautiful parts of the world, both the culture of the people and the landscape, and with the evolution of the world, this should be preserved and cherished.

<strong>GPA: How often do you tour or perform just as Jesse Paris Smith, the musician and artist? How often do you perform with your mother and/or Jackson? Any upcoming visits or performances in the Detroit area?</strong>

<strong>JPS:</strong> The amount of performing I do varies depending on the projects I’m focused on. Sometimes I go for a long while without being on a stage, and other times it feels like every week there is another show, but I have never performed or toured by myself as a solo artist. It’s been great to collaborate and perform with so many different musicians, artists, and poets over the years. My brother, mom, and I sometimes do small acoustic tours together in places like Italy, or in the Midwest, and that is nice to share with them. I also perform often with just my mom and me, which I really like, as we have more room to curate performances that include poetry, stories and different themes. Since 2008, I have been composing and recording music for film, which of course is very different from performing live, but is a challenging form of collaboration that I’ve learned a lot from.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150823164926.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>In the future, I am really excited to focus more on writing, and finding more ways to use the tool and voice of music for a greater good. In 2013, I did a nine-month professional training on integrative tools of music and sound therapy, exploring the ways that music and sound effect us on all levels. Some of the things I learned there about the effects of music at an early age reminded me of GPA, since music was such a pivotal part of the knowledge that ended up solidifying in my mind the strongest. I loved how so many teachers there used music and song as a way to help us learn and remember facts—like the 50 states, the presidents, and the days of the week in French. There are endless ways that music is a beneficial tool, and it can’t be stressed enough that it is a universal language with the power to make great change, whether it is within one individual or the collective of many or all people.

<strong>GPA: Do you consider NYC home, and if so, in which one of the boroughs do you live?</strong>

<strong>JPS: </strong>I currently live between NYC and Detroit, so I am in Michigan a lot. I spent most of the summer in Michigan. In fact, the morning of my birthday, which was June 27, my friend and I ran a 5K race on Belle Isle in the rain! It was a charity run called ‘Race and Remember,' for Hospice of Michigan. I wanted to do something special to start out my new year, and that seemed like the perfect thing to do. When I am in New York, I live in Manhattan, and when I’m in Detroit, I live in Indian Village. There are different reasons why each city feels more like home for me, but I am happy to alternate between the two, and travel to other places as well.

Michigan would probably feel more like the perfect home for me if I had a driver’s license, or if I wasn’t so used to 19 years of walking everywhere. Whenever I get to Michigan, whether it’s landing at an airport, or driving across the state line, I get a giant smile on my face. I think in a lot of cases, no matter where you end up living or become adapted to, or how many places in the world feel like home, the place where you were born and spent your earliest developing years has a special hold on your heart that you can never shake. I’m so proud to be from Michigan and I’m so grateful for spending my early childhood there and at GPA!

The phone system school-wide has been significantly upgraded, driveways and parking lots have been resealed, a new integrated camera/intercom door-entry security system was installed at all main building entrances, and major tuckpointing work on many of the brick and limestone joints was completed prior to school opening in September.</p><p class="p1">Head of School Lars Kuelling said that these much-needed repairs and maintenance efforts may not generate the same kind of excitement as curriculum development or technology enhancements. &ldquo;But they do play an important role in sustaining and protecting the nurturing learning environment inherent in a Grosse Pointe Academy education,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are especially thankful that our generous community came through once again to help make these improvements happen.&rdquo;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150906170022.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p class="p1">Kuelling also wanted to make sure all involved knew how grateful he and the rest of the Academy administration were for all of the hard work that went into not only the paddle-raise, but the entire auction weekend. &ldquo;I would like to thank everyone who had a part in this tremendous event, especially our co-chairs, Fay and Paul Savage and Lindsey and Tom Buhl, who put in a great deal of voluntary time in order to ensure the success of this year&rsquo;s auction.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1"><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Montessori school in the Chicago area thinks it's &quot;found the secret sauce to molding the entrepreneurial mindset, based in an education model that has been around for a hundred years.&quot;</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp;The Grosse Pointe Academy operates Michigan's longest continuous-running <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori program</a></strong>.</p><p><em>From <a href="http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/" target="_blank">Chicago Inno</a>, an online resource for news and info about Chicago tech, startups, innovation, funding, and more. Photos:&nbsp;</em><em>Chiaravalle Montessori</em></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150929092601.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Why the founders Of Threadless, Kickstarter see Montessori as entrepreneurship education</strong></span></p><p>By Karis Hustad - Chicago Inno&nbsp;staff writer</p><p>Can you teach innovation?</p><p>In Evanston, one school thinks it has found the secret sauce to molding the entrepreneurial mindset, based in an education model that has been around for a hundred years.</p><p>The school is Chiaravalle Montessori, located off the Dempster purple line in Evanston. At the private pre-K to grade 8 school, educators build on the traditional Montessori curriculum, which emphasizes student-driven learning, creativity, and collaboration, by reinforcing it with opportunities to launch businesses and ventures, a method that head of school Robyn McCloud-Springer calls &quot;modern Montessori.&quot; It's drawn the attention of local high-profile entrepreneurs: current parents include Jake Nickell, founder of Threadless, and Charles Adler, co-founder of Kickstarter. Though this offers just one solution, it can spark discussion of how to best prepare the kids of today to create the Next Big Thing of tomorrow.</p><p>&quot;When you're in a <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> environment it simulates what it will be like in a startup company,&quot; said McCloud-Springer.<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150929092759.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&quot;You have the ability to work by yourself, or you're going to be working with peers and you're going to have to be a leader, you're going to have to be a follower. A lot of entrepreneurial parents say...they appreciate their kids having that kind of experience at school.&quot;</p><p>It's a new framework for viewing <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> schools, the pedagogy developed over 100 years ago by Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori that emphasizes independence, self-guidance, and learning closely tied to development rather than age.</p><p>&quot;If <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> should be education for life, then we really need to be preparing kids for what kind of jobs are going to be available,&quot; McCloud-Springer said. &quot;We know so many people are inventing their own jobs these days and so we have to be really resilient, passionate, and resourceful, so [students] are able to get gainful and satisfying employment.&quot;</p><p>At Chiaravalle students still adhere to classic <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> curriculum, through guiding themselves through project-based work based on interests. It is student-driven, so if a student has an interest in fashion and the renaissance era, they may do a history project by designing and creating a costume from that time, McCloud-Springer explained as an example.</p><p>But Chiaravalle has also added additional opportunities that translate this independence to entrepreneurship. Students in older grades create businesses that have ranged from setting up a washing service for the schools' linens (they use cloth napkins and placemats), to selling keychains and trinkets they designed and printed on the school's 3D printer, to selling basil before school. Students create a business plan, manage a bank account, and decide how to spend funds. They gave their staff additional training in these methods, and recently opened a new wing with space devoted to STEM projects (to foster tinkering trial and error) and the performing arts (to inspire confidence).</p><p>The self-directed curriculum was what attracted Jake Nickell, founder of Threadless, who enrolled his daughter in <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> schools starting at age 18 months. Though he is a public school graduate himself, he said he spent a lot of his time growing up teaching himself things outside of school based on his interests, something that his daughter, now 8 and entering second grade, does every day.</p><p>&quot;People who end up choosing to be entrepreneurs have a lot of curiosity and do things in their own way,&quot; he said. &quot;As a student of <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> you're in control of your own education, but there are still guard rails around it all. Teachers are sure you're doing the work around the room, but you're doing it at your own pace...My daughter makes her lesson plan for the day.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's not like this only exists to breed entrepreneurs, but I want her to do what she wants to do, and I think this program will empower her to do that,&quot; he added.</p><p><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> schools have produced some of the most notable tech innovators of our time. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, cofounders of Google are both <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> alums. Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon), Jim Wales (co-founder of Wikipedia), and Jim Wright (creator of the Sims), also went to Montessori schools. From Chiaravalle, McCloud-Springer mentioned alums have gone onto create dance collectives, production companies, and financial services startups.</p><p>She also mentioned there has been an increased interest from entrepreneurial-minded parents, such as Charles Adler, co-founder of Kickstarter. Though Adler cofounded a major tech company, he remembers when he went to college in the early 1990s tech was &quot;certainly not something that any teacher, or my teachers could have seen, that there was going to be this job, and computers were going to be important for that job.&quot; Being able to build confidence, creativity, and resilience is a huge part of being ready for whatever comes next when running a startup, he said.</p><p>So what Adler finds compelling about <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> is that it helps kids figure out a framework for thinking that goes beyond just getting a job, but being prepared for an inevitably unpredictable future.</p><p>&quot;The world is going to change,&quot; he said. &quot;I look at my daughter and the world is going to be vastly different between now and whatever level of school she gets out of, and I want to make sure she is intellectually prepared for that and excited for that...It's finding a job, profession, line of work, and lifestyle that keeps you going and keeps your life fulfilling.&quot;</p><p>With all this being said, there is, as always in education, a question of access. Chiaravalle runs upwards of $17,000 per year in tuition (there are payment plans, financial aid, and grants available). Out of 517 schools in CPS, only three offer Montessori programs.</p><p>However, that isn't to say every kid that goes to <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Montessori</a> schools will end up running the next Google, or a student that attends a public school can't innovate--Nickell and Adler are both public school graduates. But for both parents, it does highlight what we can start doing for students at a younger age that could inspire innovation.</p><p>&quot;It's about promoting and extolling a mindset around freedom of interest,&quot; said Adler. &quot;Hopefully that becomes more accessible to everybody.&quot;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

This fall, I&rsquo;ve been sharing bits and pieces of an intriguing summer read, a New York Times best-seller by the title of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howtoraiseanadult.com/" target="_blank">How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success</a>, with our GPA parents, and I share it here because of its relevance to parents and educators alike.</span></font><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;"><br /></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">Written by Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former freshman dean at Stanford University, the book speaks to the overparenting that many educators and psychologists report seeing in today&rsquo;s society, and it offers practical advice on how parents can resist the urge to overparent and confront the stress and anxiety that modern parenting induces.</span></font><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;"><br /></span></font></p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151001105927.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">While many researchers, journalists and authors have reported on the overparenting that is prevalent in society today, Lythcott-Haims deftly reveals the underlying motivators that lead to parents becoming &ldquo;helicopter parents&rdquo;&mdash;parents ready to swoop in and rescue their child at the first sign of difficulty&mdash;before making a compelling argument for why this over-involvement restricts the development of basic life skills, harms children psychologically and ratchets up anxiety and stress levels in children and parents alike.&nbsp;</span></font><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;"><br /></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">As an educator, not much in these initial sections was news to me, though as a parent, it was good to go through her checklist of life skills that every eighteen-year-old should have (chapter 5) and to take a mental inventory of my own children&rsquo;s achievement of that skill&mdash;or not.</span></font><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;"><br /></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">Perhaps the most refreshing element of the book was that Lythcott-Haims dedicates over ONE-HALF of the book to practical approaches and actions that parents can take to most benefit their child&rsquo;s development. Clearly titled themes&mdash;such as &ldquo;Give Them Unstructured Time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Teach Life Skills,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let Them Chart Their Own Path&rdquo;&mdash;give way to a more meaningful examination of common-sense suggestions and tips within each chapter.</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">I found the most relevant chapter for the teaching profession to be the chapter &ldquo;Teach Them How to Think,&rdquo; and it would be a good starting point for a home-school discussion. After cautioning parents to be careful about &ldquo;overprotecting,&rdquo; &ldquo;overdirecting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;handholding,&rdquo; Lythcott&ndash;Haims encourages parents to reframe their conversations with their children about learning, sharing examples of useful dialogues and lines of conversation that will promote critical thinking, persistence of thought, the ability to think about more than themselves and the skill of self-advocacy.</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">In the conclusion, Lythcott-Haims observes, &ldquo;As parents our dream was to have a child, but we can&rsquo;t forget that our children have the right to dream for themselves. . .They must be the authors of themselves as well as the authors of the twenty-first century. . .&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">So yes, as a parent and an educator, I have big dreams for my children and the children of others. Here&rsquo;s hoping that I have mastered enough of the skills needed to help them dream for themselves!</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><strong><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">Lars Kuelling,</span></font></strong><font color="#666666" face="Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="line-height: normal;">&nbsp;Head of School</span></font></p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At The Grosse Pointe Academy, members of the faculty in the Early School Montessori program are called &ldquo;directresses,&rdquo; not &ldquo;teachers.&rdquo; Program founder Maria Montessori viewed the directress as a scientist, whose responsibility was not to teach the child but to connect the child&rsquo;s potential to their environment.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151012165620.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>In the following blog from <a href="http://MariaMontessori.com" target="_blank">MariaMontessori.com</a>, the author, Ed Stanford, uses the term &ldquo;guide&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;directress,&rdquo; but in the world of Montessori, the terms are interchangeable.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151012173727.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>A Montessori guide is an educator, but not a &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;</strong></span></p><p>By Ed Stanford | Montessori Blog</p><p>When we hear a title or label, our mind conjures images and stereotypes from memory and repeated experience. The stereotypical role of the conventional teacher is so different from the role of trained Montessori adults working with children in a prepared environment, that the term teacher misleads and confounds our understanding. It is for this reason that I consciously choose the term &quot;guide.&quot;</p><p>Dr. Maria Montessori described the role of a guide, or directress</p><p><em>&ldquo;Summing up her principal duty in school practice, one may state thus &shy;the mistress [guide] must explain the use of material. She is, in the main, a connecting link between the material (the objects) and the child. A simple, modest duty, and yet much more delicate than when in the old schools, the material was, on the other hand, a simple connecting link, helping to establish intellectual correspondence between the mistress, who had to pass on her ideas, and the child who had to receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>(from Maria Montessori's 1949 book, &quot;The Discovery of the Child&quot;)</p><div><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151012165842.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div><p>In a conventional classroom the teacher is the source of knowledge and she may use a myriad of approaches to transmit her understanding of a concept to the children. She may lecture or use materials (books, videos, manipulables, games, or activities). More progressive teachers create &ldquo;discovery-based&rdquo; lessons or engage in &ldquo;inquiry-based&rdquo; learning, which means they plan lessons that allow children to discover a particular learning or try to pursue the interest of the children. Methods may vary, but the structure of a conventional classroom continues to be a teacher shepherding children as a group through a scheduled curriculum (a particular lesson at a particular time).</p><p>Dr. Maria Montessori further explains</p><p><em>&ldquo;In our system, the mistress does nothing more than facilitate and make clear to the child, the very active and prolonged work which is reserved for him, in choosing objects, and employing himself with them.&rdquo; </em>(Montessori p. 206)</p><p>The key difference between a conventional classroom and a Montessori environment is found in the scientifically designed materials. The knowledge and concepts the child will learn are no longer to be found only in the adult, but are now also made manifest in the materials. Children are able to independently interact with materials (after a presentation) and learn without the direct involvement of the adult. Everyone is liberated in this structure&#894; children can follow their interests through a non&shy;-scheduled curriculum and the adult is free to guide individual children as needed.</p><p>[Stanford lists the roles and responsibilities of a Montessori &ldquo;guide&rdquo;]</p><p>&bull; A guide prepares the environment</p><p>&bull; A guide prepares a list of materials and children to ensure developmentally appropriate activities are available</p><p>&bull; A guide greets the children each morning</p><p>&bull; A guide presents materials to children who are interested and ready</p><p>&bull; A guide observes and moves as needed to inspire learning, never staying too long with any individual or group</p><p>&bull; A guide knows that her purpose is not to Teach, but to connect children with meaningful work that will impart the knowledge through its correct use.</p><p>&bull; A guide gracefully diffuses conflicts</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151012173341.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>Education is a challenging field, and both teachers and guides are highly trained professionals drawn to this work by a deep love of children and a fascination with learning. However, the methods and mindset are so very different that it is appropriate to to have a different title.</p><p><sup>Montessori, Maria. The Discovery of the Child. 1948. Reprint.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151021165658.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p><strong>Third grade teacher says nurturing each student&rsquo;s uniqueness a big part of her job</strong></p><p>Beth Ahee came to The Grosse Pointe Academy&rsquo;s lower school to teach second grade in 2007. Since then she&rsquo;s been resolutely focused on making sure each student in her classroom feels like they own a special place in the school&mdash;and in the world.</p><p>&ldquo;The most important thing I do each day is to let each child I teach know how important he or she is,&rdquo; said Ahee. &ldquo;Each child has something important to contribute and they do it in their own unique way. I am constantly engaged in nurturing each student&rsquo;s singularity, working on his or her strengths and helping them though any struggles they may encounter.&rdquo;</p><p>This now-third grade teacher also said her daily goal is to inspire students to take their learning beyond the classroom. She believes what they learn in school is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing makes me happier than to hear a student come in to class in the morning and tell me that he or she looked up something we discussed at school on their own,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I work very hard to challenge my students to go to the next level, wherever that might be for each child. I do my best to create an environment where everyone is valued and treated fairly by their fellow classmates and by me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From fashion to academia</strong></p><p>So it is beyond obvious that Ahee values her students and the education she and the Academy is providing to them. But what wasn&rsquo;t very obvious to her when she was younger was that her future career would be spent in a classroom. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not have teaching on my personal radar at all until I had my own children,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was originally thinking of fashion merchandising since that was all I knew through high school.&rdquo;</p><p>At Grosse Pointe North, Ahee was in a co-op that focused on the clothing business and she worked at a number of local stores, including Kay Baum, Willow Tree and Jacobson&rsquo;s. When she graduated from North, Ahee attended Western Michigan University, but after two years in Kalamazoo, she came home and married her high school sweetheart, Greg Ahee.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We have two boys and when they were still quite young I realized how much I valued education and how much I loved to learn,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After my younger son was born, I went back to school, this time at Wayne State University, taking one class at a time. It took me thirteen years, but I eventually graduated and have never regretted it.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahee&rsquo;s first teaching job was not at The Grosse Pointe Academy, however. After receiving her teaching degree from WSU, she signed on with Our Lady Star of the Sea elementary school in Grosse Pointe Woods where she taught for seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>But it was during a F.A.S.T. Reading System training session held on the Academy&rsquo;s campus when Ahee got a full load of what GPA was all about.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151021170139.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I grew up in the Grosse Pointes and would often pass the Academy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was always in awe of it aesthetically and architecturally, but I had never entered the building until my training and then was even further impressed. When I started teaching here in 2007, even though I felt so welcomed by both the staff and families, it nonetheless was a very hard decision for me to leave Star. But to this day, I believe I made the right decision.&rdquo;</p><p>She recalled that on her first day as a teacher at GPA, a parent came up to her, introduced herself, and gave her a big welcome hug and let her know that she was there for anything she needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151021170917.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" /><em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy teacher Beth Ahee, top right, is with students at a special outdoor gathering.</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I truly felt a sense of family from day one and could tell that the parents wanted to work with me in partnership with educating their children.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technology education and ducks</strong></p><p>Since her &ldquo;day one&rdquo; in 2007, Ahee has witnessed much change at the Academy, especially in technology and in the science curriculum offered to its students.</p><p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with our STEAM program and the ever-evolving garden program, our students are actively engaged in exploring and creating, and not just in the traditional classroom setting. I love watching my students become so excited when they see a grasshopper or butterfly in the garden and then have it lead into more investigation when we return to the classroom. And the STEAM lab also gives students many other opportunities to create and explore.&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151021170215.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ahee also believes in giving her students as many hands-on learning experiences as possible. Every year since signing on at GPA, she has hatched actual ducklings in her second-grade classroom. She said there&rsquo;s nothing better than seeing the amazement in a child&rsquo;s face as the first duckling hatches.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Now that I am teaching third grade, I probably will have to come up with something else and leave the ducks for the second grade.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It appears, though, that she&rsquo;s already well on her way to that something else.</p><p>Ahee and her third graders have been involved with Mystery Skyping, which basically is a critical-thinking competition against other classes and schools in the U.S. or the world. She said the goal in this once-a-week activity is to guess the other school's location (country, state, city, school name) before the other school guesses GPA.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We also have been regularly Facetiming with one of our former GPA families that moved to Singapore,&rdquo; Ahee said. &ldquo;With the help of a former student in that family, we are learning many interesting things about Singapore. To me, these experiences are so much more meaningful than just answering questions in a workbook.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Ahee added that since she&rsquo;s been on staff, the Academy&rsquo;s curriculum has become much more consistent across all grade levels. &ldquo;This is a very hardworking staff, totally dedicated to making GPA the best it can be,&rdquo; she said (with much emphasis).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Park visitor</strong></p><p>When she&rsquo;s not working hard on campus with her fellow faculty members, Ahee keeps a rather busy schedule off campus with her family members, which include husband, Greg, a gemologist at his family&rsquo;s jewelry business, Ahee Jewelers; son Gregory, who followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps and also is working at Ahee Jewelers; and son Will, currently a second-year law student at Harvard. &nbsp;</p><p>Ahee said she loves to travel and she and her family have been exploring lots of new places and learning about many different cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151021170245.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Ahee is with her family at a recent trip to a national park.</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Lately, we&rsquo;ve been traveling to the various national parks in the U.S., an activity I wish we had started sooner,&quot; she said. &quot;So far, we have been to parks in the Grand Tetons, Yellowstone and the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, and we look forward to seeing many more.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr. Ahee?</strong></p><p>It is abundantly clear that Beth Ahee sees herself exactly where she belongs: as a teacher and as a teacher at the Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>But what, hypothetically, if she wasn&rsquo;t a teacher. . .</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tough one! I would probably be in the medical profession, perhaps a doctor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have always been interested in the medical field, especially if I could use a holistic approach.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Ahee&rsquo;s students and her peers at the Academy are glad, however, that she chose teaching instead of medicine. The hundreds of students who have had the privilege of learning under her tutelage have no doubt benefited from her &ldquo;holistic approach&rdquo; to education&mdash;where the focus truly is on each student&mdash;the whole child&mdash;who occupies a very unique place in the world.</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Discussion focused on balancing the art of being responsive and demanding to our children.</strong>

<center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151118140758.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></center><strong>Dr. Tim Elmore speaks during the William Charles McMillan III Lecture hosted by The Grosse Pointe Academy on November 17.</strong>

Today, we not only have a new generation of kids on our hands―growing up in a world of mobile devices―we have a new generation of parents.

In our desire to protect kids or prevent anything bad from happening to them, we often end up preparing the path for the child instead of the child for the path. The result? They leave our homes unready for the world that awaits them as adults.

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150615114404.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" />Dr. Tim Elmore addressed those issues and more for parents, faculty and staff on November 17 at the 2015 edition of the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series held on The Grosse Pointe Academy’s campus.

In this unique event geared primarily for parents of school-age children, Elmore shared the research and his solutions to help avoid the most common mistakes parents make, and offer a game plan to raise healthy, productive, future adults.

“In our work with thousands of parents around the nation, we've noticed a pattern,” Elmore said. “Quite frequently, we risk too little, rescue too quickly, rave too easily and reward to frequently.”

His workshop at GPA covered how to balance the art of being responsive and demanding. He also addressed how to provide the love our children need, while at the same time, equip them to make good decisions on their own; and how to build discipline and ambition in their lives and to develop strong interpersonal skills.

Elmore's discussion provided both a helpful diagnosis as well as an insightful prescription for raising healthy, well-adjusted kids who are ready to be leaders as they graduate from both school—“and their parents.”

<strong>About Dr. Tim Elmore</strong>

Dr. Tim Elmore is a leading authority on how to understand the next generation and prepare tomorrow’s leaders today. He is a best-selling author, international speaker, and president of Growing Leaders (GrowingLeaders.com), a nonprofit that helps develop emerging leaders under the philosophy that each child is born with leadership qualities.

Elmore and his team provide public schools, universities, civic   organizations, and corporations with resources that foster the growth of young leaders who can transform society. For over 30 years, he has taught leadership through the power of images and stories that enables young adults to influence others in a positive way.

<strong>About the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series</strong>

William Charles McMillan III was a student at The Grosse Pointe Academy from 1973 until 1981 where, receiving love and encouragement, he learned to reach beyond his limitations. Although weak physically, McMillan was intellectually gifted and his passion for life, his love and concern for all living things, and his enthusiastic use of verbal skills changed the lives of those who were closest to him and left a lasting impression on all with whom he came in contact.

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150615163529.jpg" alt="" align="left" border="0" />

Never at a loss for words, he was bursting with impressions, questions and insights which came pouring out in a dazzling, dizzying torrent. It was rare to have a brief, superficial conversation with McMillan.

A friend commented, “I sometimes felt like I needed a seat belt when William was talking to me, because he would take us into outer space, back into primeval history, and then into a universe of his own imagining.”

McMillan believed that anyone could make a significant and lasting impact on the world no matter what one’s age, size or circumstance.

The William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series focuses on elementary education and is dedicated to the proposition that every child can reach beyond his or her own limitation, that each child makes the world a better place. It is the goal of these lectures to take your mind where it has never been before.

Enjoy!</p><hr /><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Historical architecture of Grosse Pointe &ndash; The school with many faces &ndash; The Grosse Pointe Academy</strong></span></p><p><em>Having recently covered the history of St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, we couldn&rsquo;t ignore the superb colonial building directly adjacent, the Grosse Pointe Academy, formally known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart.</em></p><p>Photos by Katie Doelle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924131955.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><center><br /></center><p>The origins of the land on which The Grosse Pointe Academy now sits dates back to before 1813, when the plot existed as five ribbon farms, running from Lake St. Clair to Ridge Road.&nbsp;</p><p>Detroit&rsquo;s first Sacred Heart School opened in 1851, it was located on Jefferson Avenue (near St. Peter and Paul&rsquo;s Jesuit Church), and was already overcrowded. A second Convent Academy for girls was needed, and it was decided the convent would purchase four of the ribbon farms in Grosse Pointe Farms. The size of the plot was believed to be about forty-two acres, which the nuns purchased for $15,300 (around $425,000 today). *</p><p>Due to the substantial expense to purchase the land, construction of the new school was delayed by a further twenty years. The Mother Superior had left detailed instructions so when building did commence, formal gardens, grape arbors, vegetable patches and an apple orchard had to be included on the property. One further stipulation was to include a double line of maple trees from the formal gardens to where Kercheval is today to create what is known as the Nun&rsquo;s Walk (many of these trees still exist on Kenwood Road).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924132040.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building of the new school commenced in 1883, designed by German-born architect William Schickel. Schickel had immigrated at the age of 20 to the United States in 1870, and he began his architectural career with the renowned New York firm of Richard Morris Hunt. By 1885, Schickel had formed William Schickel &amp; Company and focused much of his attention on designing many wonderful churches throughout New York City.</p><p>The boarding school for young ladies from kindergarten through 12th grade was completed in 1885. The grand four-storied Colonial Revival building with a superb view of the lake was constructed for a reported cost of nearly $100,000 (around $2.5M today). The new compound was described at the time as &ldquo;the most complete of its kind in the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924132113.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its limited architectural detailing, the rectangular building, built from dark red brick, was an impressive site. Stonework used to frame the windows and the other openings, along with stone end blocks on each of the four corners provides a nice contrast to the brick. The timeless design also features a pyramid roof (originally constructed from heavy wood), topped with two striking cupolas, along with small arched windows on the fourth floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924132149.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The interior at the time was furnished with every modern convenience. Lake water was supplied by a steam engine and distributed from iron tanks on the roof to ensure every room in the building was heated up to a standard 70 degrees.</p><p>The school was built on the property line so that the cloistered nuns were able to enter the building from within the property and the students could enter through the door that faces St. Paul&rsquo;s parking lot. The remainder of the property continued to be a self-sustaining farm providing those who lived at the school fruit and preserves.&nbsp;</p><p>By 1886, the nuns were granted permission to build a free school for the children of St. Paul&rsquo;s Parish. The addition was designed by Detroit architect William B. Stratton, husband of Pewabic Pottery founder Mary Chase Stratton, who lined many of the walls with Pewabic tile. **</p><p>In 1899, construction of a chapel next to the school began. Liturgical architect Harry J. Rill was hired to design the new building. Rill was already designing the new St. Paul&rsquo;s church and the projects ran simultaneously. The tiny chapel was built in the tradition of La Sainte Chapelle in France and features beautiful French Gothic details, carved wood, and intricately painted high vaulted ceilings. Among its most striking features are the twelve large stained-glass windows, created in Munich, Germany, that depict scenes from the life of Christ. The corners of several of these windows open up into the second floor of the school so that the older nuns could attend mass without leaving their quarters.</p><p>In the 1920s, the convent recognized the need for additional educational facilities. A portion of the farm beyond Grosse Pointe Boulevard was sold off with the proceeds used to construct the new academic building and renovate the chapel. ***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924132321.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The &ldquo;new&rdquo; school building&rdquo; was designed by Maginnis &amp; Walsh, a Boston-based firm known for its innovative design of churches (in Boston) in the first half of the twentieth century. The brick and stone facade complements the existing Lake Shore building extremely well and is in keeping with the architectural style of Grosse Pointe Farms of that era. The stone steps lead to an elegant stone terrace and large wood doors. The doors are encased by superb Gothic carvings, which lead up to the second floor windows and point to the gable above. The design presents a wonderful vertical structure, and directs the eye to the steeply pitched roof.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150924132719.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The interior is calm, and presents a feeling of warmth. It is a functional, friendly space, featuring classroom doors made mostly of leaded glass in a long hall leading to the chapel and the older Lake Shore building.</p><p>The complex now had many architectural faces, consisting of seven buildings &ndash; a farmhouse (built in 1855), four large educational buildings, and two final structures, a headmaster&rsquo;s house (built in 1939) and a maintenance shed.</p><p>In January 1969, the Sacred Heart Convent decided to close the school and the Sisters deeded the property to a lay Board of Trustees, who reopened the school as The Grosse Pointe Academy, a co-educational day school which began welcoming students again to the facility in September 1969.</p><p>The campus buildings were listed as a designated Michigan Historical site in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.</p><p>* The convent purchased the fifth lot in 1955 for $83,000.</p><p>** The building was used as a school for 40 years until St. Paul&rsquo;s constructed its own.</p><p>*** Farming continued on the property until the 1940s.</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

Below right, Patrick Ball is with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on a 2013 visit to Amman, Jordan.</em></p><p>A career with the Foreign Service in the U.S. Department of State may look glamorous and exotic to many. Worldwide travel. Government-paid housing. Generous pay and benefits. But in some instances, according to the department itself, working as a foreign service officer can be very challenging and sometimes even dangerous.</p><p>As a foreign service officer, &ldquo;you can expect to be assigned to hardship posts,&rdquo; says the State Department. &ldquo;You may face an irregular or extended work schedule. These posts can be in remote locations, without many U.S.-style amenities; there can be sporadic power outages, unreliable Internet service, etc. Health and sanitation standards can be far below U.S. standards. And some assignments are &lsquo;unaccompanied,&rsquo; which means family members may not travel to the post with you.&rdquo;</p><p>But for Patrick Ball, an alumnus of The Grosse Pointe Academy and a foreign service officer in the State Department, just like all of his previous posts, he is relishing his next one, which begins in August in Iraq.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very much looking forward to my assignment in Baghdad and I expect that it will be both a challenging and rewarding experience,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Challenging and rewarding. It appears that Ball likely has never run from the former and because of that, he&rsquo;s been able to enjoy a career thus far characterized by much of the latter, even though he&rsquo;s still a relatively young man.</p><p><strong>A Naval beginning</strong></p><p>After graduating from GPA in 1994 and then Grosse Pointe South High School in 1998, Ball attended Tulane University in New Orleans on a U.S. Navy ROTC scholarship. After that, it was law school at Wayne State University. But while he was an undergrad at Tulane, Ball joined the ROTC, which eventually led to a commission as a surface warfare officer with the Navy.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150721141828.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="" /></p><p>&ldquo;Serving in the military is part of my family's tradition,&rdquo; Ball said. &ldquo;As a young child, I have always admired my relatives' service to their country. It was an honor to serve in the Navy as a officer, especially in the challenging years following 9/11.&rdquo;</p><p>After finishing up four years of active duty in the Navy, Ball still wanted to continue serving his country, and since working for the federal government seemed to be a genuine calling, he signed up with the U.S. Department of State and became a foreign service officer.&nbsp;</p><p>Foreign service officers work in U.S. embassies and consulates, he said, and their primary mission is to advance U.S. foreign policy interests and provide help to American citizens abroad. He liked that idea very much.</p><p>&ldquo;My first assignment with State was as an economic officer and consular officer in Georgetown, Guyana,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For my second assignment, I served as an economic officer in Amman, Jordan, where I specialized in energy issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t all work, however, according to Ball.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Even though we were always really busy, it nonetheless was exciting to have such rich cultural experiences available when we could get out of the office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In Georgetown, where I developed an interest in birdwatching, there are over 700 bird species packed into a very small geographic territory. And Jordan's many historic sites, like the Dead Sea, Petra and Wadi Rum, were fascinating to visit.&rdquo;</p><p>For Ball&rsquo;s upcoming year-long &ldquo;visit&rdquo; to Baghdad, he will have someone very close to him as company during his assignment. His wife, Emily, who is an economics officer with the State Department, will be serving with him there at the same time.</p><p><strong>GPA memories</strong></p><p>It perhaps goes without saying that Iraq is a long way from Michigan and Grosse Pointe Farms. But Ball believes his education as a youngster, especially his time at the Academy, was instrumental in getting him to where he is today.</p><p>&ldquo;I really appreciate all the teachers and staff who were so important in my schooling at the Academy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I began at GPA in pre-school in 1982 and I still have fond memories of many teachers and administrators&mdash;especially my kindergarten teacher, Anne Carson, my 4th- and 5th-Grade teacher, Bob Lapadot, and those summer trips with our science teacher, Mike Fultz.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p>To request an appointment or for further information on the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, please fill out our&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/69.html" target="_blank">Online Admissions Inquiry form</a></strong>&nbsp;or contact Admissions Director Molly McDermott at 313-886-1221, ext. 146.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>How certain schools are balancing technology with Maria Montessori's call for a tactile approach to early childhood education. </b><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151101161832.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Early School students (above) at The Grosse Pointe Academy work with technology that incorporates both physical and digital sensory activity.</strong></em>&nbsp;</p><p>The essence&mdash;and some would say the beauty&mdash;of the Montessori approach to education is its emphasis on a child&rsquo;s need to move, explore and manipulate the world around him or her in order to better understand it. Program founder Maria Montessori said that &ldquo;a child&rsquo;s hands and developing brain are intimately connected.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>The dilemma facing many Montessori schools now that technology is overtaking all things education&mdash;including at the earliest levels&mdash;is how can the fundamentally hands-on Montessori way of teaching coexist with technology that is available at the touch of a mouse or the swipe on a glass screen?</p><p>And how can education technology, or &ldquo;EdTech,&rdquo; a now multi-billion dollar industry centered primarily in Silicon Valley, help younger students who most assuredly need the physical stimulus Montessori recommends?</p><p>EdSurge, an independent information resource and community focused on education technology, says that much of today's classroom technology falls short of embracing a young child&rsquo;s senses and skill set. It says the types of technology prevalent in early learning classrooms notably lack a real opportunity for tactile interactivity.&nbsp;</p><p>But according to Megan Black, The Grosse Pointe Academy&rsquo;s technology and learning specialist, teachers and younger students at GPA are embracing technology in new and exciting ways&mdash;without giving up the need to &ldquo;touch and feel&rdquo; their way through their school day. Black says she and her colleagues constantly look for the unique and the different when it comes to bringing tech to the classroom.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151101161919.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" /></p><p><em><strong>Academy students&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>have access to some of the most advanced and balanced age- and grade-appropriate technology in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;recently we actually affixed a small GoPro camera on one of our toddler students so that other students and their families can experience a day in the life of a Montessori student from a rather unique perspective.&rdquo;</p><p>And one of the things those other Montessori children are likely to see in that &ldquo;day&rdquo; is how computer tablets are being used in unique and different ways.</p><p>From the Early School through fifth grade, Black said students at the Academy have been using a digital app that makes the interaction between the physical and digital worlds almost seamless. The app is called Osmo and it has become quite popular at the Academy.</p><p>&ldquo;Early School teachers are using Osmo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;including Peggy Varty and Kate Kingsley. Also, all the teachers in Grades 1-5 use it and say they love it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Black said that by clipping a simple add-on Osmo device over the camera lens on the iPads, the chilrens&rsquo; physical creations are mirrored to the tablet and vice versa so that they can better interact with what is happening on the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;It acts quite naturally as a bridge from Montessori-based learning to effective technology integration,&rdquo; she said.</p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151101161953.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" /><em><strong>MaKey MaKey kits allow students to create their own computer controls from Play-Doh.</strong></em></p><p>According to EdSurge, there are other companies and products that have joined Osmo in putting &ldquo;control back into the child&rsquo;s hands--quite literally.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda Rosenburg, who is the director of learning at a company called Tiggly, said many companies are re-imagining and redefining &ldquo;education technology&rdquo; so that classroom computing becomes a more tactile experience for hands-on activities and learning.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This approach, called connected technology,&rdquo; Rosenburg said, &ldquo;involves pairing a physical object the child can hold, such as blocks, with a digital interface, such as a tablet or robot. Sometimes, those objects are used to gather information, as is the case with Tiggly&rsquo;s tablet-compatible physical manipulatives, or MaKey MaKey&rsquo;s invention kits. Or, as with products like Sphero&rsquo;s app-enabled robots, the physical object is on the receiving end of the data.&rdquo;</p><p>The Academy&rsquo;s Black said tech is here to stay in early education. And she says GPA&rsquo;s Montessori students truly love playing &lsquo;beyond the screen.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Our kids are now working with digital machines that allow them to use hands-on physical objects, such as letters, tangrams, paper and many of the drawing tools from the real world.&rdquo;</p><p>Administrators at the Academy&rsquo;s say that with their &ldquo;all-in&rdquo; approach to tech, students from the eighth grade all the way down to 2-1/2 year-olds in the Montessori program have access to some of the most balanced age- and grade-appropriate technology in the U.S. And they&rsquo;re quite sure Dr. Montessori would approve.</p><p>Find out more about how the Academy is creatively integrating technology with the traditional at a special <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=601&amp;page=2&amp;ncat=" target="_blank">Montessori Information Night on November 11 at 7 p.m</a></strong>.</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

JOHN REGIER / CONTRIBUTING WRITER</p><p>Two decades ago, Stacey Constantian discovered Montessori education.</p><p>Back then, Constantian was the mother of a bright 4-year-old girl who had taught herself to read. Her daughter didn&rsquo;t fit in at the parent-participation preschool she attended, nor did the program provide enough of an educational challenge.</p><p>&ldquo;The teacher couldn&rsquo;t believe she was going to have to find special work for her,&rdquo; recalled Constantian. &ldquo;They asked us not to come back.&rdquo;</p><p>Constantian began to research other options, and she soon found what she called a perfect fit &ndash; the educational approach created in the early 1900s by Maria Montessori, an Italian physician. Montessori&rsquo;s methodology stems from the belief that children learn best at their own pace while learning independently through the use of sensory materials in mixed-age classrooms.</p><p>Programs are available from infant to high school level, although the highest level offered in Orange County is eighth grade, at LePort Schools in Fountain Valley and Irvine.</p><p>&ldquo;I chose Montessori because I read a lot about brain development,&rdquo; Constantian said. &ldquo;There are sensitive periods in a child&rsquo;s life, times when the child&rsquo;s brain is growing quickly, and the brain is interested in learning something right then.&rdquo;</p><p>Constantian is such a believer in the value of Montessori education that &ndash; after becoming a Montessori educator &ndash; she recently founded her own preschool, Kensington Montessori in Laguna Niguel.</p><p>A growing number of schools in Orange County and across the United States are turning to Montessori teaching programs, but many parents still are not familiar with the &ldquo;Montessori way&rdquo; and what it looks like in a classroom.</p><p>To understand Montessori&rsquo;s approach to learning, it helps to get some background.</p><p>Montessori was the first woman to receive a medical degree in Italy. She believed that all human beings have unique potential that needs to be discovered, developed and applied at an early age. She put those progressive theories into practice in Rome in 1907, when she opened a school for impoverished children.</p><p><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=580" target="_blank"><em><strong>COMING HOME, STAYING HOME: EARLY SCHOOL TEACHER WITH DEEP GROSSE POINTE ACADEMY ROOTS IS RIGHT WHERE SHE BELONGS; SAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF HER JOB IS HAVING A SAFE, SECURE, AND WELCOMING CLASSROOM</strong></em></a></p><p>Within two years, the children who had been written off as mentally deficient were passing Italy&rsquo;s public school exams.</p><p>Montessori designed her classroom to center on the children, not the adult teacher. Everything in a Montessori room is child-size, from tables and chairs to sinks and toilets. She also grouped her students in mixed-age classes, so that older children could act as role models and teachers to younger children.</p><p>Unlike in traditional classrooms, students did not sit through group lessons in Montessori&rsquo;s classes. Instead, they taught themselves by working independently with instructional materials she personally designed, such as wooden letters and numbers, puzzles, beads and household items.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151106095831.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><strong>The Academy is hosting a Monterssori Information Night on Wednesday, Nov. 11.</strong></p><p>During preschool and the early elementary grades, students are free to move around the room and choose their own &ldquo;work&rdquo; from shelves at their level, and they are not under deadlines to complete certain tasks.</p><p>&ldquo;Every material is designed to step-by-step teach a new concept or skill,&rdquo; said Lindsay Journo, vice president of academics at LePort Montessori. The Montessori system emphasizes using natural materials, not plastic, including breakable materials such as glass pitchers or porcelain cups.</p><p>&ldquo;We believe children can learn how to handle these materials. There is a real level of trust when they are allowed to,&rdquo; Journo said.</p><p>During upper elementary grades through high school, Montessori teachers act as guides for their students, working with each child or presenting cultural lessons to the class. Rather than sitting through lectures, students are encouraged to pursue their interests. Some students may be placed in small reading groups while others work independently on math skills in class.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the biggest misconceptions about Montessori is that it is very strict,&rdquo; said Carla Hofland, director of member services at the American Montessori Society. &ldquo;Yes, the classroom is very structured in that you won&rsquo;t see Disney characters or oddball things. But within that structure, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>A child in preschool who is interested in starting her day by washing a doll, for example, is allowed to do that.</p><p>Hofland explains that self-directed activities enable children to find comfort and satisfaction in completing familiar tasks.</p><p>&ldquo;The child is allowed to do that work again and again until they are finished with it,&rdquo; said Constantian. &ldquo;A 3-year-old might enjoy pouring water from a pitcher to a glass repeatedly. Then, one day, she&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/admissions/239.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>MORE INFORMATION ON THE GROSSE POINTE ACADEMY MONTESSORI PROGRAM</strong></em></a></p><p>Montessori boasts some very famous alumni. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, chef Julia Child, video game pioneer Will Wright, author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, actor George Clooney, rap star and music mogul Sean &ldquo;P. Diddy&rdquo; Combs and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales all attended Montessori schools as children.</p><p>In 2004, Page was quoted as telling ABC&rsquo;s Barbara Walters that a Montessori education was the key to his and Brin&rsquo;s success with Google.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders, and being self-motivated, questioning what&rsquo;s going on in the world and doing things a little bit differently,&rdquo; Page told Walters.</p><p>Some research suggests that children who attend Montessori schools reap benefits in academic and social development.</p><p>Angeline Lillard, author of &ldquo;Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius,&rdquo; cited a 2006 study that found that Montessori students leaving kindergarten scored higher than their peers in public and private schools in standardized math and reading tests.</p><p>According the study, Montessori students also wrote essays with more imagination and depth than their peers did after elementary school.</p><p>But not all the research supports Montessori&rsquo;s superiority. A 2005 study found that although Montessori may provide unique benefits that extend beyond academics, the program is not associated with higher academic achievement. The study published in the Journal of Childhood Education compared the academic achievement of urban fourth- and eighth-graders in Montessori programs with students in traditional education programs, including magnet and non-magnet public schools.</p><p>Additionally, some parents question whether Montessori provides enough opportunities for group socialization and imaginative play, or worry that it is too academic of an approach for small children.</p><p><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=561" target="_blank"><em><strong>MONTESSORI DIRECTRESS BRINGS INTERNATIONAL ACUITY TO HER PEACEFUL CLASSROOM</strong></em></a></p><p>Shelling out the extra cash needed to support a private education can also have a huge effect on a family&rsquo;s decision to forgo free public education.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Education reported in 2012 that the average private school tuition for elementary school was $7,700 annually. Because schools are operated independently, full-time Montessori tuition can range anywhere from $999 to $14,000 per year.</p><p>There are two reasons Montessori programs can cost more than traditional programs, said Constantian. Materials alone for a preschool class cost about $11,000 versus just several thousand for a traditional preschool, she said. Also, the training to become a Montessori teacher is more extensive, which means qualified Montessori educators can command higher salaries.</p><p>Although the initial cost may be high, most Montessori schools do offer financial aid and scholarship programs. Moreover, more than 400 public schools offer Montessori programs, according to The American Montessori Society. Springbook and Santiago Hills elementary schools in Irvine both offer Montessori programs.</p><p>&ldquo;We are seeing growth, particularly in public and charter schools,&rdquo; said Hofland, of the American Montessori Society. The society was formed in 1960 by Nancy Rambusch to bring the Montessori approach to the American school system. It has 1,400 member schools today and certifies more than 2,000 new teachers every year.</p><p>Determining the exact number of Montessori schools in the United States is difficult because the name and method were never formally licensed or trademarked. (Montessori reportedly wanted to make sure her methods were widely available to anyone.) That means anyone can open a Montessori-based school without having to follow specific standards.</p><p>That Montessori schools are all independently run can make it difficult for parents trying to determine which Montessori school is right for their family. About 60 schools in Orange County identify as Montessori.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on a tour and see the school,&rdquo; advised Journo. &ldquo;It should be clean, beautiful and warm. It should have a productive hum of activity in a peaceful atmosphere.&rdquo;</p><p>Journo also recommends that parents ask where its teachers received their credentials. LePort, for example, hires teachers credentialed by the Association Montessori Internationale, which was founded by Maria Montessori herself.</p><p>Other marks of a quality Montessori program can include affiliation with the American Montessori Society and accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, which both require advanced teaching qualifications and higher program standards than state licensing.</p><p>&ldquo;To some families, Montessori is still a bit of a secret,&rdquo; said Journo. &ldquo;We want to change that.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="http://goo.gl/8ANVGO" target="_blank"><strong>Link to original article.</strong></a></p><div><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Visitors typically marvel at the architectural splendor that is The Grosse Pointe Academy. Whether it’s the school’s historic Gothic-inspired exterior or its bright and modern educational facilities inside, the combination of such a solid foundation with academics and technology designed for the 21st century has the Academy occupying a very unique position in elementary education in Michigan.

After The Grosse Pointe Academy's last extensive renovation of its main school building, which brought about many of the campus improvements students still enjoy today, the project (completed in August 2007) earned a number of accolades, including being selected by <strong><a href="https://webspm.com/home.aspx" target="_blank">School Planning &amp; Management magazine</a></strong> as a winner of its 2008 Impact on Learning Award.

<u><strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy - Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan</strong></u>

From outside, The Grosse Pointe Academy looks the same as it has for the past 78 years. Its stone-accented brick walls and quintessential Gothic architecture evoke a sense of tradition and pride. But on the inside, this historic school can now offer students a modern learning environment complete with 21st Century technology, larger and more functional classrooms, and inspiring special program areas.

<strong>A Rich Tradition (Visions/Goals)</strong>

The history of The Grosse Pointe Academy dates back to 1885, when the Religious of the Sacred Heart founded a school for young ladies. In the late 1920s, the renowned architect Charles Donagh Maginnis designed the Moran Building, a striking Gothic structure that became a symbol of the Academy’s rich tradition and pursuit of excellence.

At the beginning of the 21st Century, The Grosse Pointe Academy began to address shortcomings at the Moran Building. While rich in history, the building did not support a 21st Century learning environment. Classrooms were underutilized and were too small to support current educational programs. Students and teachers didn’t have access to the latest in technology. It was time for a change.

<strong>Tradition and Tomorrow (Educational Needs/Planning)</strong>

In 2004, the school embarked on a comprehensive building initiative that they dubbed “Tradition and Tomorrow.” The journey began with a comprehensive feasibility study and campus master plan that focused on ways to preserve the building while creating the best possible learning environment.

&nbsp;

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151109104428.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>&nbsp;

Administrators, teachers, and support staff participated in a three-month planning process which examined multiple schemes and explored the needs of each program area. When they were finished, the team had created a series of exciting goals:

• Provide high performance learning environments to support educational programs for grades 1-8;

• Respect and enhance the interior historic qualities of the Moran Building;

• Increase overall safety by reintegrating the reception and administrative areas into the Lower Middle School wing;

• Provide ADA access throughout all levels of the building.

<strong>Unlocking Potential (Challenges/Solutions)</strong>

Throughout the planning process, administrators and staff expressed a strong desire to preserve the historic character of The Grosse Pointe Academy. This meant accomplishing all renovations within the existing building footprint. A creative phasing plan took advantage of a recent performing arts addition to “unlock” the building and provide the necessary room for renovations. The phasing plan involved:

• Moving the performing arts program from the existing auditorium, located on the second floor, to the recently completed performing arts addition in the Tracy Field House Wing of the Academy;

• Renovating the former auditorium to serve as a library;

• Demolishing the former library and reclaiming it for use as educational space.

As a result of these renovations, the educational environment at The Grosse Pointe Academy is completely reborn. “If you drive up to the school, you don’t know anything is different. But when you walk inside you’re just blown away,” says Phil Demartini, Head of School at the time.

Classrooms on the first floor house grades 1-5 and are 200 to 250 square feet larger than before the remodel. Computers provide a technology-rich environment and encourage personal and small group research. Plasma televisions act as interactive white boards. New lighting systems with motion detectors reduce energy usage and overall operating costs.

Students also enjoy running water and drinking fountains in the classroom for the first time. Teachers have ample storage and new or historically restored millwork and cabinetry. “The attention to detail is something that people marvel at,” comments Demartini. “They say, ‘how did you get all that stuff to match?’”

&nbsp;

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151109104504.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>&nbsp;

On the second floor, middle school teachers and students enjoy the same types of amenities. Six newly expanded classrooms combine with two state-of-the-art science labs to support team teaching and collaboration. A new computer lab, located near the middle school commons, acts as a large-group instruction room and exploration center.

<strong>A Signature Space / A Discovered World (Unique features/Innovations)</strong>

The Grosse Pointe Academy wanted a building that would add to their rich history. The design team responded with the creation of a new second-floor library and a dramatic art loft, located in a converted attic on the third floor.

&nbsp;

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151109104256.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>&nbsp;

Located in the school’s old auditorium, the library is the signature space within the building. The barrel vaulted ceiling features restored ornamental wood arches and detailed paneling. Historic windows, sills, wainscot, and trim are also restored. Custom-designed new millwork blends seamlessly with the existing woodwork. Refurbished pendant lighting, along with additional discrete, supplemental, and task lighting, gives the library a sense of warmth and brings out the luster in the restored wood. The design arranges reference desks, study areas, and stack areas in a simple and efficient manner. A bank of six computers allows students to conduct on-line research in small groups or individually.

On the third floor, the former attic is home to a “discovered world.” Once a collection of cramped classrooms and storage spaces, the third floor now features a bright, airy art loft and expanded classrooms for foreign language and Christian Life. Classroom walls are now arranged parallel to the ceiling trusses, freeing the learning environment from its former constraints. The art loft supports an open studio environment with sloped walls that are reminiscent of a French garrett. Existing windows andskylights infuse the studios with natural light. A gallery wall provides a place for students to display their work.

&nbsp;

<strong>Preserving History (Materials)</strong>

As he walks the halls, Phil Demartini is constantly impressed by how restoration efforts allow him to experience the school in new ways. “It’s brought new life to the whole building. There are windows that I never saw before. There are spots that I never paid attention to because they weren’t accentuated the way they are now.”

While restoration efforts are most noticeable in the library and main corridors, they impact the entire building. Refurbished windows and doors give the building a new luster. The original Welsh tile located in the main lobby shines thanks to a thorough restoration, waxing, and polishing. In classrooms, many of the original cabinets are restored in place. When restoration was not possible or additional storage space was required, new cabinets were designed to match the school’s historic character and maintain a consistent image.

<strong>Safe &amp; Secure (Safety and Security)</strong>

A new glass wall system creates an enclosed reception office within the main lobby, allowing staff to fully supervise visitor access to the main entrance. The entire building features a sprinkler system, as well as a new elevator that is capable of transporting an entire class to any floor, including the previously inaccessible third floor art loft. In the science labs, new hoods, eyewash stations, and enhanced fire separations create a safe learning environment.

A newly reoriented main drive makes it easier for parents to drop off and pick up their children. At the same time, the drive’s meandering form adds to the beauty of the overall campus.

&nbsp;

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151109104545.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>&nbsp;

<strong>A Dramatic Rebirth</strong>

According to Phil Demartini, renovations have created a new sense of excitement within the student body. “One of the things you notice right away is the pride the kids have in the building,” he says. “They walk around with their chests out saying, ‘this is my school.’ We have the finest art rooms you’re ever going to see. We have high school kids coming back saying that they don’t have the kind of science labs we do. It’s like a transfusion. This was a great school and now it’s more than that – it’s an incredible place.”

Teachers echo Demartini’s enthusiasm. “I have so much space in my room for children to work in groups and on projects,” says Barbara Karle, a first grade teacher. “I have lots of storage space. The lighting in the rooms and hallways is so pleasant and calming. I love our new ‘old’ school building.”  For Marsha Thomas, an Academy teacher for over 29 years, the project is the best of both worlds. “After the completion of the renovation I was awestruck by the beautiful blending of the traditional and updated features.”

Michael McCuish, an eighth grade student and president of the student council, says the larger classrooms have added to the learning experience. “It is much easier for the teachers to teach, and the students to be taught because of the extra space. I believe that the renovations to our school building have made the students more eager to learn.”

Phil Demartini credits the renovation project with revitalizing The Grosse Pointe Academy. In the past year, enrollment is already up, and student and community interest is at a high point. “What we’ve done is launch the rebirth of a school that was looking for identity,” he says. “This is something that is going to keep The Grosse Pointe Academy alive for the next 100 years.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The initial launch phase of The Grosse Pointe Academy “Academy Fund” has been completed. In fact, Academy Fund Director Kristen Van Pelt discussed progress of the launch in a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYqBOQgNktI" target="_blank">video posted a couple of weeks ago.</a></strong>

But even though the Academy Fund is in its “quiet phase,” Van Pelt said, the need for ongoing support and contributions continues unabated.

“The Academy Fund is an annual appeal to support The Grosse Pointe Academy,” she said. “As such, it is the most important fundraising effort of the year in that it provides ongoing support to the operating budget, allowing GPA to offer competitive salaries, professional development and and southeast Michigan’s most unique educational experience to our students.

<strong>Technology at the Academy also benefits from contributions made to the school's annual fund.</strong>

Among specific areas within the Academy that benefit from AF support, according to Van Pelt, are ongoing enhancements to Montessori classroom materials, competitive athletic programs with travel opportunities throughout metropolitan Detroit and middle school “Real-World” experiences.

“Through this annual appeal, we also provide our students with Applied Learning (R.E.A.L.) electives classes, dedicated reading and math specialists for all students in grade 1 through 3, a dedicated technology and learning specialist, and a full-time school nurse,” a benefit for students that is increasingly rare today in primary schools, public or private.

Van Pelt said it's easy to donate by going to the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/advancement/31.html" target="_blank">school’s website at gpacademy.org</a></strong>. “And if you have any questions about the fund or about the Academy in general,” she said. “please give me a call at 313-886-1221, ext. 182, or e-mail me at <strong><a>kvanpelt@gpacademy.org</a></strong>.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151119113208.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><strong>Pathway to Paris organizers Rebecca Foon, left, and Jesse Paris Smith say the December 4 and 5 concerts will go on as planned.</strong>

Former Grosse Pointe Academy student Jesse Paris Smith is in Paris currently to prepare for the Pathways to Paris concerts, which will be held December 4 and 5. Smith and co-organizer Rebecca Foon says the concerts will "bring our voices together in solidarity, offering our love and commitment to a sustainable world."

Billed as a series of musical performances and talks “to unite around our climate and a sustainable future for our planet,” the Pathway to Paris is an initiative founded by musicians/activists Smith and Foon in partnership with <a href="http://350.org" target="_blank">350.org</a> that brings together musicians, artists, activists, academics, politicians and innovators to participate in a series of concert events to help raise consciousness around the urgency of climate action and the importance of establishing an ambitious, global, legally binding agreement at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015.

Pathway to Paris kicked off a year ago with an intimate evening of music and speakers at Le Poisson Rouge immediately following the People’s Climate March in New York City in September 2014. An intimate series of similar events have been unfolding in New York and Montreal since then. The Pathway to Paris concert series culminates in Paris this week during the UN Climate Change Conference.
<div>Smith said the upcoming climate change talks offer an enormous opportunity to send a clear signal that the world is moving away from fossil fuels “and toward a renewable energy future, while listening and problem solving with voices from around the world.”</div>
<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=592" target="_blank">Read more about Smith and her brother Jackson, who attended the Academy in the 1990s</a></strong>.

Scheduled musicians, artists and activists in Paris this week include Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein, Vandanna Shiva, Patti Smith, Thom York, Flea, Dhani Harrison, Tenzin Choegyal, Jesse Paris Smith and Rebecca Foon.

All participants donate their time, skills and talents; while the primary aim of P2P is consciousness-raising and call-to-action, the events also raise funds, with all proceeds going to 350.org. Pathway to Paris is supported by Ben &amp; Jerry’s, in collaboration with 350.org, with additional support from the United Nations Development Program, Tree Laboratory, Sustainability Solutions Group, NextGen Climate America and Modo Yoga NYC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy's Head of School Lars Kuelling recounts a special gathering held recently at the Early School. . . </strong>

“So what are you thankful for?" asked Miss Kate to the gathered Pilgrims and Indians.
<div>Around the feast table, set with items from the fall harvest and the bounty of the hard work of the room moms, sat the students from Mrs. Varty and Miss Kate's classes. Dressed in their Thanksgiving regalia, legs criss-crossed applesauce style, they patiently waited for their moment to share.</div>
<div>One by one they took their turns answering the question; some loud, some quiet, but every one sharing their thanks.</div>
<div>"I am thankful for…”</div>
<div>“…mom and dad,” “…turkey,” “…family,” “…video games,” “…jumping on the bed,” and “…sharks!” they said, with every one paying quiet attention, and no one laughing at some of the more whimsical answers coming from those assembled around a very long feast table.</div>
<div></div>
<div><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151123133332.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></div>
<div></div>
<div>After giving thanks, we prayed together, singing the Johnny Appleseed grace, before carving up the popcorn “turkey."  Each student received a serving of white meat (regular popcorn) and of dark meat (caramel popcorn) for their meal before digging in to the feast.</div>
<div>As I watched the children, I was struck by the depth of their gratitude. They all had something special to be thankful for, whether it was family, food, or fun, and they all shared it.</div>
<div>How nice that we were able to join together to remember the special message that Thanksgiving reminds us of...that on this special day we celebrate a time for family, our appreciation for the bounties set before us, and the community that unites us.</div>
<div>Thank you, Early School students, for reminding us of their importance in our lives. I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving!</div>

		<title>Parents of Early School students say GPA well worth sacrifice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151124093341.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><strong>Pictured above are the Shallas: from left, Margot (19 mos.), Kristine, Elizabeth (3), Ryan (4), and Ryan. Margot will join her brother and sister at the Academy next year.</strong>

It didn’t take long for Grosse Pointe Woods residents Kristine (Armaly) and Ryan Shalla to know that the Academy was the best place for their two children. After all, Kristine was already quite familiar with the school and with Montessori, especially since her sister, Katherine Armaly Pfeifer, graduated from GPA in 2000 and taught Montessori for a number of years in South Carolina.

But it took only a few months of her now four-year-old son Ryan in Montessori school at the Academy for the Shallas to be completely confident that they made the right decision.

“Three months into his first school year, Ryan was reciting all the continents, writing and sounding all the letters of the alphabet, successfully learning numbers, including adding and subtracting and knew all his complex shapes, just to name a few amazing accomplishments,” Kristine Shalla said. “Additionally, the interaction these Montessori children at GPA display is astounding at such a young age. They assist each other, teach each other and they empathize with each other.

Shalla’s said she has no doubt her three-year-old daughter Elizabeth, also in the Early School, will continue to excel as Ryan has. “There truly is no place like it,” she said. And the Montessori education is phenomenal.”

<strong>Sacrifice worth it</strong>

Like most parents who send their children to private schools, the Shallas believe the financial burden is well worth it. They have no qualms about telling others that they sacrifice for all the right reasons.

“Our children and their education are all that matters right now for us,” Kristine said. “They are pretty smart kids to begin with, so why would we want to keep them from such an accelerated atmosphere? It is what they know.”

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151124093412.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><strong>Elizabeth and Ryan Shalla pose at the special Academy street sign earned by their parents at the most recent Action Auction held by GPA in May.</strong>

Kristine Shalla, who grew up in the Grosse Pointe area and attended Our Lady Star of the Sea in Grosse Pointe Woods, added that from the headmaster to the maintenance crew, the Academy staff is by far the most engaged group of people she has ever had the pleasure of knowing.

“They take the time to know everyone,” she said. “They don’t judge and they welcome all your thoughts and ideas for the institution. It really is nice that you have all of that camaraderie in one place.”

<strong>Tuition not enough</strong>

The Shallas—Ryan, who is an MSU alum working at a Farmington Hills-based company called Digital Image Studios, and Kristine, a University of Phoenix alum and national sales manager for Armaly Brands, a Walled Lake-based distributor and manufacturer of Brillo Brand products—are well aware that The Grosse Pointe Academy wouldn’t be the school that it is today if it just relied on tuition.

“As a privately funded school, all these resources that GPA makes available to help our children achieve so much are made possible by the incredible generosity of Academy families,” Kristine said. “The Action Auction and Academy Fund has helped to support and will continue to support the growth of our children for years. And through our own annual-giving initiative, we have the ability to more fully support the programs at GPA. We believe that we should further help our children’s generation as well as the next one with all the great opportunities the Academy provides.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Brad Murg, a university professor in Seattle, Washington, graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1993.</strong>

Dr. Bradley J. Murg, a Grosse Pointe Academy alum (’93) and assistant professor of political science and director of global development studies at Seattle Pacific University in Seattle, Washington, presented a paper recently at a prestigious conference in Washington, DC. Titled "A Different Type of Resource Curse: Foreign Direct Investment and the Political Economy of Civil Court Reform in Kazakhstan,” the paper was introduced October 16 at the Central Eurasian Studies Society annual conference at George Washington University in DC.

A member of SPU’s School of Business, Government, and Economics, Murg’s research is supported by grants from the Social Science Research Council and the International Research and Exchanges Board, and focuses on legal reform, the political economy of foreign aid, and economic development in China and the former Soviet Union.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/260.html" target="_blank"><strong>Find out more about GPA's many talented alums in the latest edition of "The Academic" magazine.</strong></a>

Murg has been busy of late as he spent the past summer in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, researching Chinese aid policy in the region. He also works regularly as a consultant/adviser to the Asian Development Bank on development issues in East Asia. In addition to these areas, Murg is an active member of the American Catholic Philosophical Association and he is currently working on a series of articles exploring the conceptualization of poverty in contemporary Catholic social thought.

Murg graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Emory University, where he also completed his master's degree, focusing on the moral philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas. He is a recipient of the Henry Luce, William Fulbright, Morris Udall, and Henry M. Jackson fellowships and holds a M.Sc. in Economic History from the London School of Economics. His doctoral dissertation was on legal reform and economic development in China, Russia, and Kazakhstan at the University of Washington. He is fluent in French, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese with proficiency in German, Dutch, Uighur, Tagalog and Latin.

When not on campus, Murg says he generally can be found indulging his passion for kayaking off of his houseboat on Lake Union, or adding to the list of the 78 countries he has visited thus far—most recently, Ecuador.

In a further update for the Academy, Murg says his brother, Cameron, also a GPA grad, is an investment banker in Los Angeles, and sister, Stephanie (GPA alum), is a writer covering contemporary art and design in New York City.

<strong>Back to basics: Montessori education

It is not uncommon for students and parents to become unsatisfied with traditional public education, for those individuals there is a widely popular and successful education alternative: Montessori. According to Christine Krupp and Danielle McFarland, two of the Directresses at the Montessori School of Champaign-Urbana (MSCU), Montessori is not alternative. Described to me by McFarland, the Lead Directress of Elementary education, Montessori is a, “modern approach to the way human children were meant to learn.” Maria Montessori (1870-1952), the creator of this educational method, developed the system of education used at Montessori schools all around the world today through observation. She observed that children are curious and eager to learn, and that when a child is put into an environment where they are free to work, that child can thrive intellectually and socially, Krupp explained.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many in The Grosse Pointe Academy community today still retain strong ties to its past, including its roots as the Academy of the Sacred Heart. But likely many more in the community—especially parents of our younger students—know very little of the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/1.html" target="_blank">history</a></strong> of 171 Lake Shore Road prior to its 1969 transition from The Academy of the Sacred Heart to The Grosse Pointe Academy.

<strong>Students of The Academy of the Sacred Heart, now The Grosse Pointe Academy, walk through the school's front quad toward the main front entrance. </strong>

Rosalie Posselius, who is an alum, former parent and GPA’s alumni association president, has deep ties to the school from both a Sacred Heart and Grosse Pointe Academy perspective. In fact, one of her latest projects, which involved interviewing ASH alumnae for a video called <em>The Legacy Project</em>, was featured in the most recent edition of The Academy of the Sacred Heart’s main alumni publication, <em>Esprit de Coeur</em>. The article is republished below with permission of its editor, Lisa Tebbe. (A short bio of Posselius follows this article.)

<strong>Our Sacred Heart story – Sharing The Legacy Project: An interview with Roselie Posselius, creator </strong>

At the National Conference in Boston last spring, alums were treated to a screening of a video documentary, <em>The Legacy Project</em>. From heartfelt memories to hilarious stories to unforgettable Religious, with smiles, laughter and tears, the film received a resounding très bien from the audience.

The concept evolved as a vehicle to capture and preserve the feelings and impressions of Sacred Heart women and men, young and old. It is intended to be a dynamic, growing archive of how our alumnae and alumni interpret and live the legacy of their Sacred Heart education. Roselie Bellanca Posselius past central regional director, and 1973 alumna of Grosse Pointe and ’77 of Bloomfield Hills/Lawrence Ave., stepped up to spearhead the project. Along with her videographer, Roselie began the video “conversations” at the AMASC Congress last fall in Scottsdale, Ariz. The collection of interviews continued after the conference and is now available on YouTube (see below).

We had a chance to chat with Roselie who gives us a behind the scenes look.

<strong>EdeC: </strong>How did you become interested in filmmaking?

<strong>RP: </strong>My experience in video came as a natural progression from my work in theatre production. I have been producing theatre for over 20 years and had the opportunity to translate some of that work into film. It was a medium in which I could utilize my experience but still learn new ways to communicate. That initial interest resulted in my partner, J.C. Whitelaw, and me starting a video production company about five years ago.

What interests me most and consistently is telling a story. The nuances of the mediums that one can use fascinate me. And, there are an infinite amount of stories to tell.

<strong>EdeC: </strong>Can you tell us how this concept came to be?

<strong>RP: </strong>The idea of The Legacy Project was born out of a perfect storm of events. I had been working for several years in film when I became a member of the AASH Board. I had also been working on the archives of Sacred Heart in Grosse Pointe for many years. When the discussion of AASH archives was brought up at our first Board meeting in St. Charles by Mary (Forsyth), I believe we all felt that we had found a worthy project that we, as a Board, could adopt. I was lucky enough to be there and had the ability to contribute.

It reminded me of Paulo Coelho’s quote: “When you want something, the whole world conspires in helping you achieve it.”

<strong>EdeC:</strong> How did you envision the purpose of The Legacy Project?

<strong>RP: </strong>To me the story of the Sacred Heart is an important part of history. It has remained relevant in countless ways. Our founders were brilliant, brave women of faith and strength. Their mission has inspired so many. What better way to tell that story than through the people who have had the experience, those who have lived it – the alumnae and alumni. We are the product of the mission. We are the beneficiaries and with that comes the responsibility to carry on that mission.

I had been researching St. Madeleine Sophie for a speech I was asked to make for graduation at the school in Grosse Pointe and came across a quote from her that really made an impression on me: “We must know how to inspire in our pupils a passion for the beautiful. Let us put history into their souls; without that, memories will fade and we shall have wasted our time.”

I felt then that ours is a story that must be told.

<strong>EdeC: </strong>What is your process for creating?

<strong>RP: </strong>The interviews are clearly the basis for the process. The AASH Board created a set of questions and we began there. My video partner and I went to Arizona for AMASC and began filming. While asking the questions of each individual themes began to emerge, there was also unique content with each alumna. It wasn’t difficult to tell which direction to take once we started talking.

The most difficult part of the process was editing the huge amount of information. It always is. We had about 30 interviews and it took hundreds of hours to distill it down to the introductory video that we created. There were so many important messages and experiences that came throughout the interviewing process that could have been included. But, after a while, the pieces fit together like a puzzle. It helped knowing that all of the interviews would be saved in the archives and would remain available for all to examine forever. Our job was just to give a sample of what we had hoped to accomplish.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151204132714.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><strong>In 1890, students of The Academy of the Sacred Heart gather behind the Lakeshore building for a field day, which included basketball.</strong>

<strong>EdeC: </strong>It must have been so gratifying to experience the reaction from viewers. Can you describe?

<strong>RP: </strong>The reaction to the film has been great. Whenever you produce something like this, you become so close to it that you are not necessarily a good judge of whether or not it will translate from your vision to the audience’s perspective. It wasn’t really until the luncheon at the Boston Conference where we presented it that we knew we had told the story in an effective way. What a relief! Since then I have had a lot of people share their reactions with me and I am grateful and inspired to keep it going.

<strong>
</strong><strong>EdeC: </strong>Having created something of such great significance, what are your hopes for it?

<strong>RP: </strong>The truth is that The Legacy Project will preserve our memories, our traditions, our collective and individual stories for the future. It provides insight into the evolution of the Sacred Heart and its mission.

I hope that The Legacy Project serves as a means to tell the story of the Sacred Heart. I hope that people will learn the value of our history, the lessons of our founders and the necessity for this type of education to continue and flourish. I hope it serves to inspire our students, their families and the faculty that teach in our schools. I hope it clarifies ours purpose and the significance of the living Mission of the Sacred Heart now and into the future.

<strong>EdeC:</strong> Thank you, Roselie, for helping to share our Sacred Heart story. We are deeply grateful for your time and talent and for helping to connect our alums across generations!

<strong>About Roselie Posselius</strong><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151204133342.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" />

Roselie Posselius’s association with the Academy began nearly fifty years ago, when her parents brought her for an admissions interview to what was then the Academy of the Sacred Heart. She was going into first grade. Four years later she was a part of a major transition in the school’s history.

“I was entering the fifth grade when the school became The Grosse Pointe Academy,” Posselius said. “It was so exciting! The faculty was for the most part new, and there were boys, which was a major shock to the system. The school had just been saved by a group of parents led by Carole Peabody and Toni Robinson, and there was this incredible energy generated toward making it all work. The group was dedicated to carrying on the mission of the Sacred Heart in a new way."

After graduating from the Academy, Posselius attended high school at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Bloomfield Hills. She received her bachelor's degree from St. Mary's College and an MFA from Pratt Institute in New York City. She reconnected with the Academy in 1987 when her close friend and GPA classmate, Catherine O’Brien McCuish, asked her to join the alumni association board, which after six years voted her president of the organization.

In 1988, she married another Academy alum, Peter Posselius '72, representing the first marriage of GPA alums.

After having served the school for so long on a volunteer basis, Posselius returned in 2000 in a new role as a parent when her daughter, Giovanna, entered kindergarten. In 2003, she rejoined the alumni association board and now serves as president once again.

"The Academy gave me a really strong foundation on which to build,” Posselius said. “I was prepared academically, I felt supported by everyone there, and I am very grateful for the fact that I have always felt that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. I credit the Academy for that feeling."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the kids home for an extended holiday break and after most of the Christmas presents are finally either broken or ignored, it can be sometimes daunting to keep the little ones occupied and engaged until school starts again on Jan. 4. For parents with younger children&mdash;and especially for those whose children attend Montessori schools&mdash;a little advice might just be at hand in a blog written earlier this year on <strong><a href="http://popsugar.com" target="_blank">POPSUGAR.com</a></strong>, which is a website dedicated not only to parenting but to an &ldquo;all-embracing lifestyle and cheerful philosophy built around the power of happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <strong><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/moms/Practicing-Montessori-Home-37019549" target="_blank">linked article below</a>&nbsp;</strong>from POPSUGAR, blogger Kate Steilen discusses how parents might keep the wee ones occupied at home with many of the same activities inspired and advocated by Maria Montessori herself. Good advice no matter if it&rsquo;s Christmas-vacation time or &ldquo;any&rdquo; time. . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my daughter was accepted into a public Montessori school at age 3, I only knew a few details about what that meant &mdash; a mixed-age classroom and special tools that children used that were called &quot;work.&quot;</p>
<p>If your kids aren't yet in school, or you haven't encountered it before, the Montessori philosophy may seem opaque. A typical Montessori classroom has a specific layout of tools and materials to allow students to choose what they are interested in. Teachers are referred to as guides and talk about children doing &quot;work&quot; in a &quot;prepared environment,&quot; engaging with the &quot;peace curriculum&quot; and &quot;spontaneous self-discipline.&quot; None of this sounds like my child. But Maria Montessori's ideas about children's growth &mdash; and the successfulness of her program &mdash; are interesting in their own right and easily applicable to working and playing with your children at home.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a gray, blustery, but quiet day on The Grosse Pointe Academy&rsquo;s campus this Saturday after Christmas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But while faculty, staff and students are on a well-deserved holiday respite, this beautiful school on the shores of Lake St. Clair with its aged yet solid bones continues to look forward to the day it welcomes everyone back from Christmas break 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Parents of second- and fourth-graders say the Academy has all the right stuff for their children.</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151218090922.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p><em><strong>The MacQueen family, above, clockwise from top left, Jason, Tomia, Naomi and Caitlin, is at Caitlin's kindergarten graduation in 2012. Caitlin now is in the fourth grade and Naomi is in the second grade at GPA.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Tomia MacQueen stood up to talk about The Grosse Pointe Academy in front of the impressionable young prospective families in attendance at GPA&rsquo;s recent Montessori Information Night last month, it was clear she was passionate about the school where she and her husband send their two children.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After all, Naomi and Caitlin MacQueen, in the second and fourth grade, respectively, have been attending the Academy since each was 2-1/2 years old. And the MacQueens themselves didn&rsquo;t just decide on the Academy willy-nilly. In fact, right after Tomia and her husband, Jason, a financial manager, moved to the Detroit area from New York&mdash;when Caitlin was a little more than a year old&mdash;they began to search for schools in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But not just any schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tomia MacQueen wanted a Christian-based school&mdash;that was number one on her rather long list of requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Having a school with Christian foundations was very, very important to me personally, but I didn't want just any Christian school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everything else had to be right as well. I wanted a top-notch Christian school. We really liked the combination of small class sizes at the Academy, the curriculum content, flow, and then the transition to a more standard classroom setting after Montessori in the Early School.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MacQueen also wanted a school that would support and underscore all of its students' understanding and appreciation of the differences in other ethnicities and cultures.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Being an interracial family, the continuity and consistency of what our girls are taught at home in that regard was paramount,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Being in a predominantly Caucasian environment myself as a young child, I knew that our girls would go through the natural and various phases of feeling different, i.e., skin color, hair, etc., and as expected, they did. But I&rsquo;ve noticed and have been extremely pleased with the level of communication and interest that the teachers at GPA have had in the well-being of not only our children, but all of their students on every level.&rdquo;</div>
<div><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151218091003.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></div>
<div><em><strong>Naomi and Caitlin MacQueen are in London in 2013.</strong></em>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>The coolness factor</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MacQueen said that faculty and staff clearly care and often find ways to incorporate the uniqueness, or &ldquo;the coolness&rdquo; of each of the kids into everyday classroom life. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I even once discovered, after one of my daughters struggled to find a crayon color to match her skin color, that a line of skin-tone colored pencils was available,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They were readily incorporated without question into the everyday classroom supplies by an Early School teacher who thought they were very cool. It may be a minor thing to adults, but to a child, being able to see him or herself as their own person and represented accurately in family drawings is extremely important and can have a lasting effect on their idea of the normalcy of their own color.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long story short, she said, is that her expectations of the Academy in that regard were exceeded and that she has a confidence in GPA teachers and administration that she herself never experienced as an African-American child in similar environments. &nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Not just about the academics</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The MacQueens also say the education they are providing for their children cannot be measured in dollars or tuition, or even just academic results. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Tomia, who grew up in Detroit and graduated from Hunter College of the City University of New York, The Grosse Pointe Academy is an investment not just in an advanced education, but in having well-rounded children who excel in their own little niches, and are appreciated for who they are, which she says can&rsquo;t help but spur them into even more growth as students and unique individuals.&nbsp;</div>
<div><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151218091035.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></div>
<div><em><strong>Caitlin is with mom, Tomia, at a Halloween celebration at the Academy in 2013.</strong></em>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;As a third-grader, Caitlin was reading at the middle of a fifth-grade level, and as a fourth-grader she has since added about two levels to that,&rdquo; MacQueen said. &ldquo;Just to give you an example of how Caitlin has taken to reading, we don't really worry about or see too many electronics at the dinner table,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we do often have to make Caitlin put away the book she's hiding under the table.&rdquo; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to MacQueen, Caitlin gets extra help at GPA from the school&rsquo;s librarian and teachers in combining her higher reading level with appropriate content that interests her so that she continues to advance. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Still another reason why we think GPA is worth it,&rdquo; she added. &nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Confidence, consistency and math</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It&rsquo;s also worth it, MacQueen said, because her second-grader, Naomi, is in love with math, which she believes started in Early School Montessori when she began counting things with abandon. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;When Naomi was in kindergarten, she would annoy her big sister, who was in the second grade at the time, by doing Caitlin&rsquo;s homework over her shoulder,&rdquo; MacQueen said. &ldquo;The kids were actually multiplying without even knowing it in the Early School, so when they got to a more traditional math methodology in the lower school, they weren't daunted. They were still learning, but not afraid of math at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MacQueens also have noticed an extraordinary amount of general confidence growing in each of their children since matriculating at GPA and it appears that Tomia does not doubt for a minute their decision to send their daughters to the school. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;When we see them confidently asking whatever question comes to mind, of anyone, anywhere, we know they are in the right place.&rdquo; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;And when we hear them communicate a thought so clearly, articulately, AND with consideration of others, that is just further confirmation for us,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also when I ask Caitlin what she wants to be when she grows up, and she says &lsquo;an entrepreneur.&rsquo; Or when&mdash;as just a 4th grader, she has consistent business plans and acts on them, works towards them, and has the confidence to expect to be backed up in her endeavor, yet is perfectly happy to go at it alone if she needs to&mdash;we feel entirely justified in our decision to send them to the Academy.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always teaching the girls these kinds of things at home, but we also want our children&rsquo;s school to reinforce what they learn at home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That consistency is another big reason why our kids are here at The Grosse Pointe Academy.&rdquo;</div>

<p><strong>From left, above, Bill and Kelley Smith, and Robin and Kim Kendrick were named co-chairs for the 2016 Action Auction, which is slated for May 7 at The Grosse Pointe Academy.</strong></p>
<p>At The Grosse Pointe Academy's Legends Party, which was held on Dec. 1 at the home of Kristi and Jim Penman in Grosse Pointe Farms, school officials announced the chairs for the 2016 edition of the Action Auction. The event, which also honored past auction chairs and former trustees, was a kick-off party for the auction, scheduled for May 7, 2016, on the Academy&rsquo;s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.</p>
<p>Bill and Kelley Smith, and Robin and Kim Kendrick were named co-chairs for the auction and Connie and Brian Demkowicz were named honorary chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the auction is in May, much of the real action is already happening now,&rdquo; said Kristen Van Pelt, GPA&rsquo;s director of development. &ldquo;Led by our co-chairs, honorary chairs and the many volunteers, plans are going full swing. They currently are gathering hundreds of donations, advertisements and corporate sponsorships as well as planning the decorations and other arrangements that will make the auction the Pointes&rsquo; biggest event of the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151217110808.jpg" border="0" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Last year&rsquo;s auction netted more than $450,000 for the Academy&rsquo;s academic offerings, scholarship and tuition assistance funds, and support for the preservation of its historic campus.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The auction theme this year is &ldquo;F&ecirc;te des Amis &ndash; Together We Flourish,&rdquo; and Van Pelt said the school is bringing together 49 years of community leadership for one spectacular evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The event is a great tribute to the dedication and hard work of so many within our Academy family,&rdquo; Van Pelt said. &ldquo;So mark your calendars for Saturday, May 7, and look forward to a great night to support our school.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Current Academy directress discovered the advantage of Montessori and fully embraced it.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carrier_bd4a4840_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26362"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26362" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/carrier_bd4a4840_1000px.jpg" alt="carrier_bd4a4840_1000px" width="1000" height="834" /></a>

The Grosse Pointe Academy employs one of the best teaching staffs in the State of Michigan. Highly educated and credentialed, from Early School to eighth grade, GPA staffers are ensuring that all students graduate with every advantage a budding high school "citizen" can possibly have.

Those advantages, which the school proudly and collectively tags as "The Academy Advantage," most importantly begin in the longest continuously running Montessori program in the state. Which is where longtime "directress" Mary Jo Carrier educates GPA students--part of her family, she says--who range in age from 2-1/2 to 5.

"I always tell the children that we are like a family," Carrier said. "We spend almost everyday of the week together and like a family, we work together, and we need to help each other and be kind to each other. I believe that in this way, the children feel the classroom is their own peaceful place where they play a meaningful role in caring for themselves, each other and their environment."

Carrier, who has a B.A. from Marygrove College and is credentialed in A.M.S. Early Childhood, first came to the Academy "environment" in 1994 after spending a couple of years at the Giving Tree Montessori School in Detroit as a directress, and after raising a family once a short career as a medical social worker ended.

"As a medical social worker, I was responsible for the placement of patients from hospitals to nursing homes or adult foster care, which needless to say was a pretty sad job," she said.

So after leaving the workforce, Carrier and her husband, Mark, raised four children--three sons and a daughter--who she said are now all very active adults.

"I was happy to stay home for 13 years raising our kids, keeping active in all their sports, clubs and school activities. But as education had always been a priority in our household, I began to think of returning to the work force in part to help ensure our own children would have choices for their future."

<strong>Loved the Montessori 'difference'</strong>

As she was exploring a new career in education, a friend of Carrier, who happened to be a primary directress at Giving Tree, asked her to come and work at Giving Tree and also to bring her daughter to begin school there. Carrier said that since her boys were a little older, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to jump back into the workforce.

"I found this was a wonderful place to start working again and it's where I found my love for the Montessori way of teaching," Carrier said. "It was so different from the traditional approach in education. I loved how it stressed independence, order and the freedom to choose work and I began to see that young children were so much more capable of doing things for themselves if we just stepped back and allowed them to do so."

She loved the hands-on materials in the Montessori classroom and saw how they made a real difference in each child's learning.

"But most of all I loved to see joy on the children's faces as they took learning into their own hands, treated each other with kindness and respected their environment because they were fully invested in its care," she added.

Beginning her Montessori career as a primary assistant at Giving Tree, Carrier worked with 1st through 3rd graders there for about four years after which she decided to check out the possibility of working in Montessori at The Grosse Pointe Academy, which was actually already quite familiar to her. In fact, by that time, she was very heavily involved with the school, serving on various school committees, working as a classroom assistant and even teaching science and Catholic Formation.

"All the teachers at GPA were wonderful mentors and wholeheartedly supported me in getting a Montessori certificate," she said. "So after Anne Carson retired, I was lucky enough to get her classroom."

Replacing a 35-year veteran, she said, was no easy task, but she jumped in with great gusto, often working from seven in the morning until six at night. "The cleaning staff finally complained that I was at school way too many hours," she said.

<strong>School is beautiful, staff is friendly, welcoming</strong>

Asked about first impressions of GPA, Carrier said that since she attended Catholic schools all her life, she had a built-in recognition and understanding of the legacy and traditions of GPA, both past and present. "Also, I quickly gained an appreciation for the property in all its glory of the changing seasons," she said. "The buildings, the trees, the lake--what more beautiful setting could an employee work in?!"

"I loved coming to work everyday! The staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming, the children and parents were happy and everyone was glad to be at school everyday."

Twenty-one years have passed since Carrier first walked through the doors of GPA. And she still loves coming to work each and every day.

"Just like day one, I still believe the most important thing I can do for the children at GPA is to provide a safe, nurturing environment for every one of them," she said. "And this caring, peaceful place makes for such an optimal learning environment, where children can engage alone or cooperatively in meaningful learning experiences that will surely help them can grow socially, emotionally, cognitively and physically."

<strong>Ireland roots</strong>

Now that her children are all grown--three are married and all have successful careers, Carrier said--she and her husband are starting to spend more of their free time chasing around the country, visiting her kids and "four beautiful grandchildren."

"Our children's interests and jobs have taken them to West Point, New York City, Washington, D.C., Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., and Traverse City," she said. "And we love to travel. In fact, we are looking forward to spending several weeks in Ireland this summer, which will allow us to discover more about our Irish ancestry and lineage that is centered in the village of Puckane in County Tipperary."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we headed into 2016 with excitement and a full head of steam, The Grosse Pointe Academy took a look back at some of 2015's compelling stories about alumni who continue to do awesome things in the community, at college or in their careers.

It is amazing that when we speak to former students, to a fault they all say how truly important the foundation of education received at the Academy was to their ultimate success, whether that be in high school, college or at work—or all three!

In no particular order, we’ve compiled below some of the alumni highlights of a very highlight-filled year at the Academy. (Click on a headline to go to the article.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy alum looking forward to college says GPA prepared him well for prestigious IB school in Troy and beyond; mom agrees</strong>

James Raudabaugh, a 2012 Academy graduate who will be speaking at Tuesday’s GPA State of the School event, is finishing up his last semester at the International Academy, a highly rated school that consistently finishes near the top of U.S. News and World Report’s list of the best high schools in Michigan.

What actually got him to IA, a school that offers the rigorous International Baccalaureate curriculum to its students, was a well-thought-out written entrance test, a mother who managed to assuage Raudabaugh’s fears that the school may not be right for him, and eight years at The Grosse Pointe Academy.

“My time at GPA really helped me gain the confidence and self-awareness I needed to make the choice to go to the IA in the first place,” Raudabaugh said. “I initially was worried that IA was a school only for future engineers and doctors and I’ve always known I wanted to definitely pursue a different path. But the best advice my mom gave me was that I should start at the IA, which begins its school year two weeks before Grosse Pointe South, and if it didn't feel right, since I also was enrolled at South, I could go to plan B and start at South after Labor Day without missing any school days.”

But at the end of only his first day at IA in mid-August, he told his mom to “un-enroll” him from South.

“I knew on day one it was the right place for me, even though getting up at 6:15 a.m. on school days has been hard at times and the carpool across town to Troy made after-school activities a challenge,” he said. “But my mother always tried to pick me up when I had to stay late for something.”

Raudabaugh adds that there were a number of students from his GPA class who wrote the entrance exam for IA, three of whom ended up attending the school with him.

According to Raudabaugh’s mother, Susan Gittins, a Toronto native who now works in the Detroit area for a global consulting firm, the transition from GPA to IA for her son was very smooth.

“His only initial disappointment was not being able to take Mandarin at IA since he studied and enjoyed it at GPA,” she said. “But he quickly picked up Spanish instead and last year he actually spent time in Spain living with a family and attending a Spanish high school.”

<strong>From Chicago to Grosse Pointe Farms</strong>

Raudabaugh lived the first six years of his life in Chicago with his family and had been in a Montessori preschool in Wilmette, a suburb of Chicago. When the family moved to the Detroit area, his mom spent a lot of time looking for the right school for him to start first grade.

“First of all, I wanted James to be with other kids who also had transitioned from a Montessori background into a more conventional academic program,” Gittins said. She said her original plan was to move into the Birmingham/Bloomfield area and send her son to either Cranbrook or the Academy of the Sacred Heart.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160207134921.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Raudabaugh as a GPA eighth-grader is with his mother, Susan Gittins, in this photo taken for the school's Action Auction. </strong></em>

&nbsp;

But a redirection to the Grosse Pointe area for the family led to a meeting with then-admissions director Molly McDermott and a tour of GPA.

“I did research other schools in the Pointes, but GPA was the only one to meet all my requirements,” Gittins said. “The Academy easily ticked off all my ‘must-have’ boxes, starting with the first one: having a language class in grade one. Number two was having gym/movement/exercise every day. Three was a Montessori early school so James would transition to the classroom environment alongside other children coming from Montessori; four was early music study, and finally, number five, having all of this in a beautiful and welcoming environment.”

Gittins said she can't say enough good things about the experience she and James had at The Grosse Pointe Academy. And she said she’s always been at the ready to defend the cost of a GPA education.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank"><strong>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE ACADEMY'S EARLY SCHOOL MONTESSORI PROGRAM</strong></a>

“My philosophy always has been to invest in the early years of education and then see the ROI in the high school years,” she said. “By the time kids get to high school, usually habits are already formed, including good and bad ones. I was comfortable sending my child to a public school for high school as I was confident the foundation had already been laid at GPA.”

It was worth every penny, she said.

“What I paid for were all the must-haves I mentioned before,” she adds. “Plus, studies show that language and music, along with regular exercise, are instrumental in developing young minds. I’m not saying that DNA doesn't also play into it, but private schools can offer all the stimulants you need to give your child the best possible start in their education career.”

<strong>Focus on film school</strong>

For James Raudabaugh, even though he’s not yet started college, he’s already got pretty clear career plans and goals. He wants to make movies—“movies that matter”—he said, and when he gets to college in the fall, he’s going to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and major in film production.

He’s been accepted thus far to Emerson College in Boston, University of Michigan, University of Denver, Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Windsor. He is awaiting word on Northwestern, Syracuse University, Vassar, Wesleyan, Oberlin and Concordia University in Montreal, all of which should be able to accommodate his expected degree in the arts.

“Making movies is what makes me the happiest,” Raudabaugh said. “I’ve always had a camera in my hand. I love the creative outlet of putting ideas into a visual format. Although I am not a very good artist in the conventional sense when it comes to drawing or painting, I think I have a strong artistic mindset. So film has been a good outlet for me, combined with music.”

Raudabaugh established a film club at the International Academy and has acted in a number of the school’s drama club productions, including most recently, Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night.” He also plays guitar for IA’s jazz band and is the president of his school choir.

A busy young man to be sure. But getting back and giving back to The Grosse Pointe Academy also has been a regular feature for Raudabaugh.

Each fall for the past several years, he’s on the Academy’s campus quite often as he helps out with the school’s cross-country teams. He notes that it’s a sport that anyone can do and the feeling of accomplishment it leaves you with as you improve your time or even just finish the course is powerful for gaining self confidence.

“I also love the look of satisfaction on the kids’ faces as they cross the finish line,” he said.

Raudabaugh also helps out at the Academy during the summer with its innovative Camp Invention, one of the school’s most popular summer camps.

An added bonus, he said, is that whenever he comes back to GPA, he gets to hang out with some of the teachers he had at the school.

“I have fond memories of Mr. Lapadot in grades four and five,” he said. “And Mr. Cowan, Ms. Jerome, Ms. Roberts, and my Mandarin teacher, Lucia Hu, all were favorites as well. But, really, I can say I’ve always had positive teacher experiences the whole time I was at the Academy.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As children move from infancy to toddler — and yes, the “terrible twos” — they often are thought of as difficult to control and willfully unruly.

But Judi Orion, director of training for Association Montessori Internationale, and director of training for assistants to infancy at the Montessori Institute in Denver, Colo., says, however, that before a toddler’s free will fully develops, there is a strong and special energy that is actually directing the child’s behavior.

“That energy is often referred to as the ‘horme,’ which is sometimes defined as a life force,” she says. “And this ‘life force’ is pushing those young children to become what they’re supposed to become.”

She says these young children have an extremely active horme (pronounced “horm-ay”).

“So children are not being unruly or disobedient to adults,” Orion says. “They are in fact obeying this internal force.”

<div>Montessori founder Dr. Maria Montessori originally defined this “life force” as part of the building of character and the formation of personality in young children. She actually borrowed the term horme from Sir Percy Nun, an English philosopher, as her own label for it.</div>
At The Grosse Pointe Academy, children as young as 2-1/2 years old begin this character-building, this developmental journey, in the nurturing environment of the Academy’s Early School, the longest continuously operating Montessori program in Michigan.

Children in the Academy’s Montessori program are given the freedom to combine this “horme,” this very strong life force, with the excitement of learning on their own so they can perfect their own individual talents under the guidance of experienced and caring teachers.

Experience this Montessori “experience” yourself as well as metro Detroit’s most comprehensive elementary-school program on March 2, from 6-8 p.m., when The Grosse Pointe Academy hosts an all-school open house on its beautiful Grosse Pointe Farms campus.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy alum’s catch helps Broncos along path to Super Bowl</strong>

<em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy alum Bennie Fowler breaks free from a tackle during an AFC divisional playoff game vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers.</strong></em>

On January 17, former Grosse Pointe Academy student Bennie Fowler came up with arguably the biggest catch of the season up to that point for the Denver Broncos in its AFC divisonal playoff game against Pittsburgh.

Quarterback Peyton Manning and the Broncos faced a third-and-12 at their own 33-yard line with 8:40 left, trailing the Steelers 13-12.

Denver, to that point, was just 1-of-12 on third-down conversions and Fowler had one catch for four yards.

But on this pivotal play, Fowler, who currently is listed third on the Broncos’ depth chart as wide receiver, lined up in the slot and beat Pittsburgh cornerback Brandon Boykin on an in-route, and then broke a tackle attempt by safety Will Allen to pick up another 13 yards.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160202105005.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Former GPA student Fowler is a wide receiver with the Denver Broncos.</strong></em>

Nine plays later, the Broncos scored the go-ahead touchdown that put Denver up for good in a game that took them to the AFC championship game where they beat New England. Fowler and his Broncos teammates now await the Feb. 7th Super Bowl in San Francisco where they face the Carolina Panthers.

Fowler, a 2005 graduate of the Academy, who played high school football at Detroit Country Day and then in college at Michigan State University, signed with the Broncos in 2014 as a free agent. He made Denver’s active roster this year after spending his first season on the team’s practice squad.

<strong>GPA, DCD and MSU accolades</strong>

Fowler’s on-field and in-classroom prowess began at the Academy, where, in 2005, just before graduating from the eighth grade, he was named “Athlete of the Season,” an honor given each year to a student-athlete who excels in athletic achievements, leadership abilities, academic performance and citizenship.

At GPA, Fowler was the co-captain and leading scorer of the boys varsity basketball team, and set a school record for points in a season, which led to him being named most valuable player by his teammates. Fowler also played on the school's lacrosse team and was listed on the school’s prestigious “citizenship” list.

At Detroit Country Day, he was named an honorable mention all-state selection by the Associated Press as a senior all-purpose player (1,478 yards and 15 TDs).

He appeared in 44 games (15 starts) during his collegiate career with the Spartans and recorded 93 catches for 1,341 yards (14.4 avg.) with 11 touchdowns in addition to 16 rushes for 102 yards (6.4 avg.) and one score.

Fowler, who was an economics major at MSU, also had 15 kickoff returns for 336 yards (22.4 avg.) for the Spartans and led the team in receiving yards (622) and receiving touchdowns (6) on 36 catches (17.3 avg.) as a senior in 2013.

For the Broncos in 2015, Fowler has 16 catches for 203 yards, for a 12.7 yards-per-catch average.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>GPA students benefiting from a continuum of curriculum in music and the performing arts</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160127172907.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p>Today, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would have celebrated his 260th birthday.&nbsp;That is, of course, if he was still with us.</p>
<p>Born January 27, 1756, Mozart left such a legacy of music and composition before his untimely death at the age of 35 that his birthday and musical footprint are heralded with such pop-culture fervor each year that you might think he was a member of the Beatles or Rolling Stones. Well, then again, maybe not the best comparisons. . .</p>
<p>But while it&rsquo;s unclear yet whether the next Mozart &mdash; or Mick Jagger &mdash; is currently walking the historic hallways of The Grosse Pointe Academy, a number of notable musicians <em>have</em> attended the Academy over the years and they likely have benefited from one of the most comprehensive music programs found in a primary school in southeast Michigan.</p>
<p>Former students like Jackson Smith, who has toured with the likes of Elton John, Leon Russell and Greg Allman, and who has made a name for himself as one of the Detroit area&rsquo;s premier session musicians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or Jackson&rsquo;s sister, Jesse, a composer and multi-instrumentalist who has performed globally in many configurations, collaborating with other musicians and artists, including Soundwalk Collective, Tenzin Choegyal, Tree Laboratory, Shyam Nepali as well as her mother, Patti Smith, and brother, Jackson.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160127173225.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p><em><strong>From left, former Grosse Pointe Academy students Jesse Paris Smith and brother, Jackson Smith, are with Jackson&rsquo;s wife, Lisa, their mother, Patti Smith, and family friend Mike Pigeon.</strong></em></p>
<p>Or perhaps Regan Chuhran, who was voted &quot;Most Likely to Win a Grammy&quot; by her eighth-grade classmates and who also played in 2008 for First Lady Laura Bush at a prestigious event held at the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club. In addition, Chuhran has been on staff at the Interlochen Center for the Arts and she sits in occasionally as an organist/pianist at St. Mark Lutheran Church in Roseville, Mich.</p>
<p>And we must include guitar phenom R.J. Ronquillo, who graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1990, and has since been all over the world supporting musical stars like Stevie Wonder, Ricky Martin and Thompson Square.&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-2016012717344200px" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p><em><strong>Noted musician R.J. Ronquillo, above, graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1990.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<div>Ronquillo, Chuhran and the Smith siblings are just a few of the thousands of former GPA students who have had access to a music and performing arts curriculum that begins with 2-1/2 year olds in Early School Montessori and carries all the way through middle school in a continuum of music education based largely on the nine &quot;national standards of music education&quot; as prescribed by the National Association for Music Education.&nbsp;</div>
<div><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160127175221.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></div>
<div>GPA&rsquo;s Early School curriculum guide says its music program encourages &quot;participation in singing, reciting rhymes, and poetry. Combined with movement, this program will help refine large motor skills and encourages each student to interact as part of a group. Songs, drums, stories, recorded music, finger plays and nursery rhymes all contribute to the child&rsquo;s introduction to singing and pitch, rhythm, beat and patterns.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<p>More information on all of the Academy&rsquo;s music and performing arts curriculum offerings is available <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/13.html" target="_blank">online&nbsp;here</a></strong>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Cooperation and respect for others among lessons learned at GPA by alum.</strong>

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160125173440.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

<em><strong>James Cargas, who graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1980, is running to be representative of the 7th Congressional District in Texas.</strong></em>

In today’s strongly bifurcated political environment, it is maybe rare to find a politico who is running for a seat in the federal government who says he longs for the “golden era,” when those on both the blue and red sides got along well enough to actually accomplish something; a politico who also thinks good manners and respect—lost arts perhaps—would go a long way in getting things done today.

James Cargas, a 1980 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, currently is chasing the <strong><a href="http://www.jamescargas.com/home" target="_blank">7th Congressional District seat in Texas</a></strong>. He is running against the district incumbent who Cargas says is falling short in delivering what its citizens need.

“The 7th Congressional District now is an excellent example of an entrenched member of Congress who has lost touch with the district,” Cargas said. “He has a pattern of voting for purely political reasons and against his constituents’ best interest.”

And keeping constituents’ best interests at the forefront is why Cargas is running this year, he says.

He also says that even as far back as his lower school days at the Academy, some of the lessons learned then still help inform his modus operandi when it comes to compromise and cooperation in the real world of government and politics.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank"><strong>INFORMATION ON THE ACADEMY'S EARLY SCHOOL PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE HERE.</strong></a>

“Having first, second and third grades in one area of the school was a wonderful experience in community and collaboration among students with different needs and abilities,” he said of those days at the Academy. “And so when elected, I plan to work very hard to duplicate some of that atmosphere of community and collaboration in Congress.”

<strong>Journey to Washington goes through Texas</strong>

Cargas’s long and impressive educational career thus far has taken him from the Grosse Pointe Farms campus of GPA, through University Liggett high school in Grosse Pointe Woods, to Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan and finally to Washington, D.C., at American University’s Washington College of Law, where he earned his law degree.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160125173529.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Cargas is with his wife, Dorina, left, and the former mayor of Houston, Annise Parker.</strong></em>

During that time, Cargas has had more than a taste of how government works—from the local level up to halls of Congress in Washington.

While in law school in D.C., Cargas focused on energy and environmental law, served as president of the Environmental Law Society, and wrote a monthly column called “Law of the Jungle” in the student magazine. A job with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission led to positions with a major D.C. law firm, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, and ultimately the Clinton White House on the President’s Council on Sustainable Development.

“I finished out the Clinton administration at the U.S. Department of Energy under Secretary Bill Richardson,” Cargas said. “In 2001, when President George W. Bush was elected, I found a great job as an energy and environmental lawyer in the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas.

Then, in 2008, Bill White, who was Houston’s mayor at the time, hired Cargas as the city’s energy counsel responsible for advising the mayor on all aspects of energy procurement and energy transactional matters. Under Mayor Annise Parker, White's successor, Cargas was city attorney and also advised the City of Houston on contract, environmental, real estate and regulatory matters.

<strong>Boy Scouts and pine trees</strong>

This compulsion to serve his fellow citizens, according to Cargas, started when he was in the Boy Scouts, which is where he first got a taste of politics volunteering with now-retired Congressman David E. Bonior, who represented Michigan's 10th and 12th Congressional districts.

“As a scout, I often volunteered for Bonior’s campaign by passing out pine trees door-to-door, which is what David and his volunteers often did during his campaigning,” Cargas said. “Then, while at U-M, Rep. Bonior offered me a summer internship on Capitol Hill. In order to earn college credit, I enrolled in American University’s summer program and lived in their dorms. It was a great experience during that summer, seeing how legislation was crafted, hearings were held, and votes were taken. Rep. Bonior was part of the Congressional leadership at the time and I had the opportunity to meet Speaker Tip O’Neill, Sen. Claude Pepper, and many other national leaders.”

After Cargas graduated from Michigan, Bonior needed a deputy press secretary and offered Cargas the position, which he accepted and held before starting law school. On Bonior’s staff he said he had some of his most fulfilling early legislative experiences.

“When I was on Rep. Bonior’s staff, Jim Wright of Texas was the house speaker,” Cargas said.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> “We worked with certain Republicans on some bills and they opposed us on others. It was never personal; just each member doing what was best for their individual districts. It was how Congress had operated for over 210 years. Looking back, it seemed like a golden era of cooperation and democracy.” </span>

Bonior, for his part, remembers Cargas well.

“Very early on, way before he came to Washington, I worked with James and his family in my district in Michigan as a liaison to the Greek community,” Bonior said. “His family was very well respected. James was a thoughtful, persistent, fine young man, including the time he was part of my communications group. If elected, I believe he will do a fine job for his constituents.”

<strong>Why Texas?</strong>

Cargas said he is well-entrenched in Houston, loves living and working there, and is most especially grateful for the city because that’s where he met his wife, Dr. Dorina Papageorgiou, a neuroscientist who works at Baylor College of Medicine’s Department of Neuroscience.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160125173609.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Cargas is with his wife, Dorina, in 2015 during a July 4th parade in Houston.</strong></em>

He also said his devotion to and interest in energy and environmental issues make Houston, which has more than 70 wind and solar energy companies, the perfect place for him. In addition, despite Texas currently being a very “red” state in terms of politics, it has a strong history of Democratic leadership.

“Texas gave America many powerful national Democratic leaders,” he said. “People like President Lyndon Johnson, House speakers Sam Rayburn and Jim Wright, Governor Anne Richards, Senator and Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Sen. Ralph Yarborough, and Representatives Mickey Leeland, Martin Frost, and Barbara Jordan, to name a few.”

He reminds that Texas was a deep blue state before it was a deep red state, and urban areas such as Houston remain Democratic-leaning communities with Democratic mayors.

Cargas said that when he gets to Congress — it’s not “if,” it’s “when” — he’ll have a lot on his plate. For his district, he wants to bring light rail westward, return funding for biomedical research to formerly high levels, and implement comprehensive energy reform.

For his country, he said he wants to work across the aisle to balance the federal budget. “As an alum of the Clinton administration – the last administration to balance the budget -- I know this is difficult, but the benefits will be well worth the effort,” Cargas said.

He also includes targeted tax cuts for small businesses, innovative unemployment insurance reform, making the payroll tax cut permanent, and preventing the layoff of teachers, police, firefighters and other essential public servants important components of his Congressional to-do list.

<strong>Respect</strong>

Asked about any further memories from his time at The Grosse Pointe Academy, Cargas, whose sister, Vicky Steensma, also attended GPA, said there is something from the Academy he will always hold close.

“Some of the most lasting lessons that GPA teaches young people include manners and respect for others,” he said. “I recall losing a baseball game at the Academy in second or third grade and being rather upset. But the coach  took the time to talk to me about sportsmanship, the importance of leaving the competitiveness on the field, and looking forward to a rematch tomorrow. Those are heavy concepts for a six year old to take in, but I did, and it has stayed with me today and will be with me probably forever.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy grad is making art (and scarves) in Austin.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paige-edit-crop_600px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26702"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26702" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paige-edit-crop_600px.jpg" alt="paige-edit-crop_600px" width="600" height="717" /></a>

Paige Russell, a 2004 alumna of The Grosse Pointe Academy, graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design and now operates a studio and business in Austin, Texas.

It’s likely no one yet has pondered how to combine the Fauvist vision of Henri Matisse, the psychedelia of Peter Max and the ambiguous Gothic realism of Sandro Botticelli into one piece of art.

Well, wait a minute. . . maybe we did find that one person. And she’s not only creating such art suitable for some of the world’s premier galleries, she’s turning it into something you can wear.

Paige Russell, a 2004 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, is making waves in both the art and fashion worlds with her collection of vibrant-colored scarves inspired by, she says, “strange dichotomies of pop-art patterns influenced by day-to-day life.”

Calling what she does “transcending the two-dimensional,” Russell’s scarf-making process begins with large, hand-cut pieces of brightly colored paper that she uses to create roughly two-ft.-by-two-ft. 2D fantasies of shape and color that are both beautiful and compelling. But, it’s what she does with many of those 2D fantasies that is drawing so much interest from the fashion world.

After a painstaking and labor-intensive process of digitizing her paper “paintings,” Russell turns the art into luxurious printed silk scarves, the likes of which have been garnering favorable comparisons with those sold by the famous Paris-based Hermès House of Scarves.

But what got her to what she calls her “deranged technicolor ramblings on silk” is a study in hard work, perseverance and, yes, an excellent academic beginning at The Grosse Pointe Academy.

<strong>Going against the grain</strong>

“I feel grateful that at the Academy we were all pushed to do a bit of everything — academics, sports, chorus, art, drama, etc.,” Russell said. “I didn’t fully realize it at the time, but now as an adult, I still meet people and notice how integral those small things are that contribute to making a person so well-rounded.”

She said she often thinks about former Academy teachers Mr. [Mike] Fultz and Mr. [Bob] Lapadot. “Both were great teachers and a bit eccentric, which made going against the grain seem like a really smart thing to do,” she added.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160122135830.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center> <em><strong>Russell begins each design with paper cutouts of color.</strong></em>

Russell attended GPA from Early School through eighth grade:  “Did the long haul,” she said — after which high school followed at Grosse Pointe South. The transition to high school went well for her as it included a heavy dose of art and design from the start.

“I really didn't do many extracurriculars at South, but I was in the art building any chance I got,” she said. “Art has always been on my agenda. I don't recall ever wanting to do anything else.”

After high school, Russell matriculated to the Savannah College of Art and Design, a well-respected art college in Savannah, Georgia. She majored in graphic design because she figured it was the most “marketable” major in terms of making a living.

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160122135905.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

<em><strong>Russell calls her scarves “deranged technicolor ramblings on silk." </strong></em>

“I also thought graphic design was open enough that if I were to change my mind, it would still apply to most anything else I wanted to do in the art world,” she said.

And what she is actually doing in the art world now is certainly gathering media attention. Russell already has been featured in U.K.’s The Sunday Times, Huffington Post, Style Bubble, Cool Hunting, the Bulletin and in Austin Monthly, which is published in Austin, Texas, Russell’s new adopted hometown.

“I was on my way to San Francisco to make my life there, and by a twist of fate I got the flu in Austin and ended up staying,” she said. “I’m so glad I did.”

<strong>Matisse and ‘happy accidents’</strong>

Operating out of a small studio just east of the University of Texas at Austin in a business called <strong><a href="http://www.eloi.us/" target="_blank">“ELOI,”</a></strong> Russell says colors, sometimes many colors, are always on her mind.

“Color is such a huge part of what I do,” she said. “I usually have an idea brewing as I come up with a palette that really gets me excited. Once I begin, and after any planning I’ve done ahead of time is thrown out, it sometimes can become a mess. But then everything changes, I play some more, and lots of happy accidents occur.”

Originally, the idea of printing her work onto scarves, she said, seemed like a good way of reproducing her original paper cutout pieces. She loved the idea of putting her art on an object so simple, and on one that can be used all the time in a lot of different ways.

And about a major art inspiration: “I have always loved Matisse, but at first I didn't realize he did paper cutouts until I'd been doing this for a couple of years,” she said. “But it’s not just his cutouts. It’s his regular paintings also that are a huge influence for me!”

<p>All works are evaluated through a series of blind adjudication, first on a regional level by more than 100 local affiliates of the Alliance, and then nationally by an impressive panel of creative-industry experts. This past year&rsquo;s group of jurors included artist Andres Serrano, poet Nikki Giovanni, Warhol Museum Director Eric Shiner, artist Wangechi Mutu and comic artist Dash Shaw.</p>
<p>According to Erin Brott, Tomlinson&rsquo;s art teacher at the Academy, a&nbsp;ceremony honoring Tomlinson and other local award winners will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 9, at 7 p.m. at the Detroit Film Theatre located in the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Current Academy directress discovered the advantage of Montessori and fully embraced it</strong></p>
<p>The Grosse Pointe Academy employs one of the best teaching staffs in the State of Michigan. Highly educated and credentialed, from Early School to eighth grade, GPA staffers are ensuring that all students graduate with every advantage a budding high school &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; can possibly have.</p>
<p>Those advantages, which the school proudly and collectively tags as &ldquo;The Academy Advantage,&rdquo; most importantly begin in the longest continuously running Montessori program in the state.&nbsp;Which is where longtime &ldquo;directress&rdquo; <strong>Mary Jo Carrier</strong> educates GPA students&mdash;part of her family, she says&mdash;who range in age from 2-1/2 to 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always tell the children that we are like a family,&rdquo; Carrier said. &ldquo;We spend almost everyday of the week together and like a family, we work together, and we need to help each other and be kind to each other. I believe that in this way, the children feel the classroom is their own peaceful place where they play a meaningful role in caring for themselves, each other and their environment.&rdquo;</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160114113110.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrier, who has a B.A. from Marygrove College and is credentialed in A.M.S. Early Childhood, first came to the Academy &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in 1994 after spending a couple of years at the Giving Tree Montessori School in Detroit as a directress, and after raising a family once a short career as a medical social worker ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a medical social worker, I was responsible for the placement of patients from hospitals to nursing homes or adult foster care, which needless to say was a pretty sad job,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>So after leaving the workforce, Carrier and her husband, Mark, raised four children&mdash;three sons and a daughter&mdash;who she said are now all very active adults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was happy to stay home for 13 years raising our kids, keeping active in all their sports, clubs and school activities. But as education had always been a priority in our household, I began to think of returning to the work force in part to help ensure our own children would have choices for their future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loved the Montessori &lsquo;difference&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>As she was exploring a new career in education, a friend of Carrier, who happened to be a primary directress at Giving Tree, asked her to come and work at Giving Tree and also to bring her daughter to begin school there. Carrier said that since her boys were a little older, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to jump back into the workforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found this was a wonderful place to start working again and it&rsquo;s where I found my love for the Montessori way of teaching,&rdquo; Carrier said. &ldquo;It was so different from the traditional approach in education. I loved how it stressed independence, order and the freedom to choose work and I began to see that young children were so much more capable of doing things for themselves if we just stepped back and allowed them to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She loved the hands-on materials in the Montessori classroom and saw how they made a real difference in each child's learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT GPA's MONTESSORI PROGRAM </strong></em><strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>HERE</strong></em></a></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;But most of all I loved to see joy on the children's faces as they took learning into their own hands, treated each other with kindness and respected their environment because they were fully invested in its care,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Beginning her Montessori career as a primary assistant at Giving Tree, Carrier worked with 1st through 3rd graders there for about four years after which she decided to check out the possibility of working in Montessori at The Grosse Pointe Academy, which was actually already quite familiar to her. In fact, by that time, she was very heavily involved with the school, serving on various school committees, working as a classroom assistant and even teaching science and Catholic Formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the teachers at GPA were wonderful mentors and wholeheartedly supported me in getting a Montessori certificate,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So after Anne Carson retired, I was lucky enough to get her classroom.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Replacing a 35-year veteran, she said, was no easy task, but she jumped in with great gusto, often working from seven in the morning until six at night. &ldquo;The cleaning staff finally complained that I was at school way too many hours,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><strong>School is beautiful, staff is friendly, welcoming</strong></p>
<p>Asked about first impressions of GPA, Carrier said that since she attended Catholic schools all her life, she had a built-in recognition and understanding of the legacy and traditions of GPA, both past and present. &ldquo;Also, I quickly gained an appreciation for the property in all its glory of the changing seasons,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The buildings, the trees, the lake&mdash;what more beautiful setting could an employee work in?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved coming to work everyday! The staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming, the children and parents were happy and everyone was glad to be at school everyday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twenty-one years have passed since Carrier first walked through the doors of GPA. And she still loves coming to work each and every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like day one, I still believe the most important thing I can do for the children at GPA is to provide a safe, nurturing environment for every one of them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And this caring, peaceful place makes for such an optimal learning environment, where children can engage alone or cooperatively in meaningful learning experiences that will surely help them can grow socially, emotionally, cognitively and physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Ireland roots</strong></p>
<p>Now that her children are all grown&mdash;three are married and all have successful careers, Carrier said&mdash;she and her husband are starting to spend more of their free time chasing around the country, visiting her kids and &ldquo;four beautiful grandchildren.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our children&rsquo;s interests and jobs have taken them to West Point, New York City, Washington, D.C., Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., and Traverse City,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And we love to travel. In fact, we are looking forward to spending several weeks in Ireland this summer, which will allow us to discover more about our Irish ancestry and lineage that is centered in the village of Puckane in County Tipperary.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div>&ldquo;This is education, understood as a help to life; an education from birth, which feeds a peaceful revolution and unites all in a common aim, attracting them as to a single centre. Mothers, fathers, politicians: all must combine in their respect and help for this delicate work of formation, which the little child carries on in the depth of a profound psychological mystery, under the tutelage of an inner guide. This is the bright new hope for mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>
<div>(from Maria Montessori's 1949 book, &quot;The Absorbent Mind&quot;)&nbsp;</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a Jan. 4, 2016, blog (available below) written by a Montessori school administrator in New York City, a discussion reveals how both divergent and convergent thinking&mdash;especially divergent thinking&mdash;informs creativity in education, specifically the Montessori philosophy of education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divergent thinking skills are considered to be at the heart of creativity and creative thinkers use both divergent and convergent thinking,&rdquo; said Dr. Kathy Roemer, executive director of Twin Parks Montessori Schools in NYC. &ldquo;Many of us have heard Sir Ken Robinson talk about the decline of divergent thinking in schools where students are taught to know one correct answer. &lsquo;Divergent thinking isn&rsquo;t a synonym, but is an essential capacity for creativity. It&rsquo;s the ability to see lots of possible answers to a question, lots of possible ways to interpret a question, to think laterally, to think not just in linear or convergent ways, to see multiple answers, not one.&rsquo; (Robinson, 2009). The Montessori method encourages divergent thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roemer also talks about the narrow distinction between enhancing creativity for students by changing conditions in their environment (a central tenet of the Montessori pedagogy) vs. simply trying to make them think more creatively. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Montessori Education and Creativity</strong></p>
<p>Posted on January 4, 2016, by Kathy Roemer</p>
<p>Maria Montessori believed that beauty could be found in nature and that nature offers an infinite source of creative imagination. She encouraged teachers to develop children&rsquo;s connections to the world through the use of their senses and to use nature to foster creativity. Although Montessori did not see the value in telling or reading fairly tales or in children&rsquo;s abstract art, she did believe children should have opportunities to draw from life and nature if they were inspired to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sensory education which prepares for the accurate perception of all the differential details in the qualities of things, is therefore the foundation of the observation of things&hellip; it helps us to collect <strong>from the external world the material for the imagination</strong>.&rdquo; &ndash; Maria Montessori</p>
<p>A few years ago, I visited Beijing as a representative of the American Montessori Society. I was impressed by the rapidly increasing number of Montessori schools that are educating young students in that metropolis, one of the largest and most complex on earth. It was fascinating for me to see students performing the same math, practical life and sensorial lessons experienced by American Montessori school students. On the other hand, I witnessed some of the language and culture activities in the classrooms that are unique to Chinese culture and arts. The intricate sewing and watercolor painting especially impressed me. What is it about Montessori that is inspiring this prevalence I witnessed?</p>

<p><em><strong>Constellations sewn on fabric in a Montessori school in Beijing, China. (Kathy Roemer)</strong></em></p>
<div>Montessori schools are rapidly opening in China to help promote creativity in education. Dr. Yong Zhao, a forerunner in global education from the University of Oregon, expressed to the audience at the 2011 AMS Annual conference in Chicago that there are many things &ldquo;right&rdquo; with American education and that China and other &ldquo;Asian nations are actually reforming their systems to be more like their American counterparts.&rdquo; Dr. Zhao stated, &ldquo;No other country comes close to the U.S. when it comes to exports of intellectual property/knowledge (patents, royalties, copyrights, license fees). Diversity of talents, creativity, entrepreneurship, and passion are what allow nations to thrive.&rdquo; The New York State Association of Independent Schools is sponsoring a trip for educators in conjunction with Dr. Zhao in April of 2016.&nbsp;</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>On the anniversary of an historic 18th Century balloon trip, we look back at that event as well as GPA&rsquo;s own extraordinary balloon trip, which occurred last January.</strong></p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160107091156.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 7, 1785, an American and a Frenchman became the first people in history to cross the English Channel by air. In their case, it was in a gas balloon and the trip&rsquo;s length, while in dispute, likely was between 20.6 miles and 150 miles, which is the minimum and maximum distances over the length of the Channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(1785) Across the English Channel in a balloon</strong></p>
<p><em>(From the History Channel)</em></p>
<div>Frenchman Jean-Pierre Blanchard and American John Jeffries travel from Dover, England, to Calais, France, in a gas balloon, becoming the first to cross the English Channel by air. The two men nearly crashed into the Channel along the way, however, as their balloon was weighed down by extraneous supplies such as anchors, a nonfunctional hand-operated propeller, and silk-covered oars with which they hoped they could row their way through the air. Just before reaching the French coast, the two balloonists were forced to throw nearly everything out of the balloon, and Blanchard even threw his trousers over the side in a desperate, but apparently successful, attempt to lighten the ship.</div>
<p>Fourteen months earlier, French inventor Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier and French army officer Francois Laurent had made the first manned hot air balloon flight when they flew over Paris for approximately 25 minutes. In January 1785, Rozier was among those racing to become the first balloonist to cross the English Channel, but just a few days before Blanchard and Jeffries&rsquo; flight, he and his co-pilot were killed when their balloon caught fire during an attempted crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Academy students release balloon from campus grounds</strong></p>
<p>Almost a year ago&mdash;January 29, 2015, to be precise&mdash;Grosse Pointe Academy middle-school students in GPA teacher Robert Rochte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Near-Space Explorations&rdquo; R.E.A.L. class launched their own balloon, albeit unmanned, on a trip of more than 500 miles.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160107093935.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 30-foot balloon, filled with helium and equipped with a payload box containing a GPS tracker and a mini digital camcorder ended up in a field in Shawsville, Virginia, 509 miles from the school&rsquo;s Grosse Pointe Farms campus. It eventually made its way to a middle school in Shawsville where students there connected with the Academy student &quot;engineers&quot; in an exciting and informative video teleconference.</p>

<p><em><strong>Class of 1980 alum is making wine and winning awards in San Francisco. (Facebook)</strong></em></p>
<p>Bryan Kane graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1980. Since then he&rsquo;s earned a BBA from the University of Michigan and an MBA from UCLA. After school, he remained on the West Coast, working in Silicon Valley for a number of software and tech firms, including Apple Computer and Oracle Corporation.</p>
<p>Although he&rsquo;s no longer involved full-time in the software industry, Kane still keeps one toe in it with his over 20 years of experience in strategic alliances, business development, and product marketing and management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s got the rest of Kane&rsquo;s toes and both feet even more involved in is winemaking, an industry, like the tech industry, also heavily centered in northern California. Strangely enough, though, making wine in San Francisco proper, the city that anchors all things northern California, has been rare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is until Kane got involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been making wine in San Francisco for as long or longer than anyone else,&rdquo; Kane said in a recent video interview. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s since about 2004 when I first started in a place in the Mission District.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This award-winning winemaker now operates a thriving 20,000 sq. ft. winemaking and event facility still in the city but on Treasure Island, which straddles the San Francisco Bay between downtown San Francisco and the City of Oakland.</p>
<p>Kane has taken an old U.S. Navy airplane hangar, turned it into the &quot;Winery SF&quot; and transformed it into the place to be for California wine in the big city.</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160103163355.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p><em><strong>GPA alum Bryan Kane ('80) operates the Winery San Francisco on Treasure Island in the City of San Francisco.</strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Winery SF is about bringing that whole California wine experience to the people in the city and to be part of the community,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our promise is to bring an affordable and accessible wine to the community and to give back to the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kane said the operation has contributed tens of thousands of dollars back to various civic activities in San Francisco, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation. He&rsquo;s also proud of the fact that Winery SF uses winemaking methods that are earth-friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are good to the earth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We use sustainable methods and earth-friendly bottles, which is important to us as a certified sustainable winery and &lsquo;natural winemaker.&rsquo; I wanted to bring all of that &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; to San Francisco, the city I live in and love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Bitten by the wine bug early</strong></p>
<p>Before the Winery SF, Kane had been a wine enthusiast and collector for years. While his first exposure to the wine industry was as a consumer, his passion for distinct and interesting wine led him to become immersed in the wine industry&mdash;first as a collector and then as a home winemaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back as far as the time he spent in grad school at UCLA, he was exploring winemaking even as he pursued a career in tech. He began by making wine at home, but after learning as much as he could from the winemakers he respected, Kane gradually improved on his own winemaking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started off as an enthusiast, but was very fortunate to work with some great winemakers along the way,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But, after years of begging top vineyards for &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; (grapes left on the vine by the purchasing winery) or commercial winemakers for a couple of hundred pounds of grapes for his home winemaking, he said it was time to take the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in 2004, Kane was convinced by a friend (and fellow home winemaker) to begin making wine commercially at his crush facility. In an effort to share his passion for wine, especially great Zinfandel- and Rhone-based wines, with others, Kane formed his first commercial winemaking business called Vie Wines, which is one of the wines featured at the Winery SF.&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160103163423.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center>
<p><em><strong>The Winery SF is a converted U.S. Navy airplane hangar on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay.</strong></em></p>
<p>Kane also owns a vineyard north of Napa Valley, and between the grapes he grows himself and those he sources from other vineyards in the area, he makes and markets wines branded as Vie, Winery SF and Sol Rouge, the latter of which he said is focused on producing wines from grapes descended from Southern France's Rhone and Bordeaux regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are currently partnering with vineyards in California who produce these varietals and who have distinct soil profiles similar to our terroir and those microclimates similar to that of these great wine regions of France,&rdquo; Kane said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Award-winning winemaker</strong></p>
<p>France and San Francisco are a long way from the Grosse Pointe Farms campus of the Academy where he attended grade school, but it appears that Kane in his adopted hometown in California is doing just fine now with his wine.</p>
<p>In 2013, Winery SF was voted one of San Francisco&rsquo;s best wineries, and his various brands have earned a barrel full of awards over the years, including a gold medal in the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition (2015) for his 2013 Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast; a silver medal in the 8th Annual American Fine Wine Competition (2015) for his 2013 Chardonnay; and double gold medal from the American Fine Wine Competition, best of class from the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition (2014) and the Top Cabernet Sauvignon under $25 in America from the American Fine Wine Competition for his 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>8th grader (who wants to be on the U.S. Supreme Court some day) and her classmates publish new newspaper for Academy students</b>

Is there a future in journalism for Maria Fields, an eighth grader at The Grosse Pointe Academy? Or perhaps one day might she serve on the U.S. Supreme Court? Actually, both jobs may be on the horizon for this talented and ambitious student, who is finishing up what is inarguably one of the most successful Academy careers in some time.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160217093627.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy 8th grader Maria Fields says she'd like to have a career in journalism and one day serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.</strong></em>

Fields recently published the inaugural edition of “The Grosse Pointe Academy Times,” which she and two of her classmates, Nafi Sall and Molly Woods, established on their own initiative. Woods is the creative editor and reporter for the newspaper and Sall creates the comics and is a reporter, according to Fields, who serves as the publisher and editor.

“Through discussions at my lunch table with Molly and Nafi, we saw the need and decided to establish a student newspaper,” Fields said. “I intend to publish it once a month.”

She said the newspaper will have a different theme each month.

“Generally, we will have a reporter interview other students about the topic or theme,” she said. “And every newsletter will include a main article, a student-written column, student book reviews, and a ‘random-act-of-kindness’ article written and submitted by a student.”

According to Assistant Head of School for Instruction and Grades 1-8 Principal Lawrence DeLuca, Fields approached him about starting a student newspaper.

“She put the paper together completely on her own with the help of Nafi and Molly,” DeLuca said. “We originally discussed distributing it only for middle school, but after seeing their first copy, I thought it would be something all the grades could enjoy. They showed great initiative and the work they did on the newspaper was impressive.”

Impressive may also be a good word to describe Fields herself and what she’s accomplished during the years she’s been at GPA.

This past December, Fields earned three first-place awards and a first overall in the Eastside Catholic Forensics League competition held at St. Joan of Arc school in St. Clair Shores. Last May, Fields won a gold medal as she scored a #4 national ranking and a #2 local Detroit-area chapter ranking in Le Grand Concours, a highly competitive French exam sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of French. Also in May, she was inducted into the National Junior Honor Society along with 16 of her classmates.

Last spring, Fields brought home the top prize in a speech and essay contest sponsored by the Clinton Township Area Optimist Club. Her winning essay explained how she started the G.R.O.W. program at the Academy in order to provide extra help to the school’s first and second graders with their reading, schoolwork and homework. G.R.O.W. stands for Generating Real Opportunities for Wonder and the program is managed primarily by Fields who even provides the snacks during tutoring sessions.

In September, Fields was one of the Academy students chosen to give a speech at the school’s opening ceremony, which welcomed students in Grades 1 through 8 to a new school year. And, in late 2014, Fields helped host the C.A.T.C.H. Night of Champions, an annual charity event attended each year by more than 400 people.
<p style="text-align: left;">On top of all this, Fields is finishing up her term as National American Miss Michigan Pre-Teen, a title she earned last summer. According to National American Miss, which sponsors the Miss Michigan Pre-Teen pageant, thousands in scholarships and prizes are given out to recognize and assist the development of young women nationwide, with emphasis placed on the importance of gaining self-confidence, learning new skills, learning good attitudes about competition, and setting and achieving personal goals.</p>
<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160217094051.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

<em><strong>Fields was named Miss Pre-Teen Michigan in a pageant held last summer.</strong></em>

So what is next for Fields as she contemplates high school and beyond and continues to set her own goals?
<p style="text-align: left;">A career in journalism is in the mix, according to Fields, who said she’d love to work on a student newspaper in high school. But her career goals also include something a bit more lofty.</p>
“I would like to become a U.S. Supreme Court justice,” she said. “Nevertheless, that does not mean I cannot be a journalist along the way.”

Based on what Fields has accomplished in her still very young life, there are no doubts that she will be successful in whatever she pursues, including serving on the highest court in the land.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy grad goes above and beyond with caring for co-workers and for the community in Wayne.</strong>

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160218102321.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy alum Jay Bonnell (Class of 1982), right, is with Beaumont Hospital—Wayne President Eric. W. Widner in the hospital's "hero hall."</strong></em>

The Grosse Pointe Academy’s approach to nurturing the "whole child” — which emphasizes character development through leadership and community service opportunities — bears witness nearly every day with students in the current school population. We also see on a regular basis that many of the Academy’s alumni are giving back to their communities in significant and amazing ways.

Case in point: Jay Bonnell, who graduated from the Academy in 1982, is the controller at Beaumont Hospital’s Wayne, Michigan, location. As the point person on all things financial at the hospital, Bonnell works behind the scenes to make sure budgets are in place to fulfill the needs of the staff and physicians so they can provide the best in care to the community.

He’s also been a generous, but “quiet,” donor to many of the philanthropic activities within the hospital itself as well as in the surrounding communities.

So when it came time for Bonnell to be recognized for his own benevolent efforts, it was no surprise to those who know him that he opted instead to defer that recognition to others.

As an Oakwood Foundation President’s and Legacy Society Member, Bonnell took the naming opportunity he earned by his generosity and instead honored the entire exceptional workforce at Beaumont–Wayne. The result was the Hero Hall, named in honor of site president Eric. W. Widner and dedicated to showcasing the staff and physicians who provide exceptional care to patients.

<strong>A 'most humble' manner</strong>

“Jay has made a tremendous impact on the programs and services we provide at Beaumont Hospital – Wayne,” said Michelle Anderson, interim executive director of the Oakwood Foundation. “And he has made this impact in the most humble and unassuming manner."

His gifts have helped provide equipment for the Beaumont Breast Care Center – Wayne, supported the Summer Speech Therapy Program, which as underwritten by Bonnell, provided more than 45 children with speech therapists who worked with them to help overcome communication barriers.

He also offered a challenge grant that matched the Beaumont Spirit of Giving Campaign contributions made by management at the hospital, and he has also made arrangements through his estate plan to make a significant gift to support patient care.

A controller for the Beaumont–Wayne facility since 2013, Bonnell began his Beaumont career as manager of surgical services at Beaumont’s Grosse Pointe location in 2010. Prior to this, he served in a number of financial analyst positions with Ryder Integrated Logistics and General Motors. He earned BA and MBA degrees from Michigan State University.

<strong>Impactful employee</strong>

“Jay has taken significant personal action by making charitable investments in areas that impact patient care, and, challenging our staff and leadership to do the same,” said Dr. Neelam Kumar, Oakwood Foundation chair and physician supervisor of pathology at Beaumont–Wayne. “The wonderful thing about Jay is that he sees the personal side of things. He speaks directly to our physicians, our patients, their family members and staff each day. Because of that, I think that Jay has a unique perspective into the impact of charity and philanthropy.”

The hero hall, which is prominently located in the hallway behind the hospital’s main lobby, includes many photos of hospital employees who have gone above and beyond to impact the lives of patients.

“I see that impact each day I come to work,” Bonnell said.

Widner said even though Jay chose to honor him with the naming of the hero hall, it really is Jay’s spirit that is reverberating through the hallway.

“Jay’s enthusiasm and his passion for this hospital, for our coworkers, the physicians and for our patients, radiates from him,” Widner said. “This hallway is designed to celebrate the caring heroes on our team, but it really demonstrates Jay’s commitment to excellent patient care and the community. We are so fortunate to have him as a partner, as a colleague and as an investor in our efforts.

“I think this is a fantastic way to honor the dedicated staff members and physicians who go above and beyond to provide exceptional care to our patents and their families.”

<center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160223090422.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></center><em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy middle school students in the R.E.A.L. program spent time this week at Detroit's College for Creative Studies to learn more about the industrial and graphic design industries.</strong></em>

While a number of their classmates are in Europe this week on a class trip, students in the 6th, 7th and 8th grades have been taking advantage of all the opportunities provided by the Academy’s innovative R.E.A.L. program, which engages students in real-world tasks that extend classroom learning, employ cross-disciplinary thinking, make connections to the world outside of their classroom walls, and create innovative solutions and products as a result of their work.

In other words, they are learning what the real world of work is really like!

On Tuesday of this week, the students found out how to “<strong>build a brand</strong>” at Airfoil Group, a marketing and public relations firm in Royal Oak, where they learned first-hand from real professionals how to market and keep fresh the product websites they’ve been working on and how best to maintain consumer interest in their products.

Wednesday had the students at Oak Park-based Ringside Creative, a multi-media production company that works with Ford, the Detroit Red Wings and DMC among many other clients. GPA students learned from professional, creative artists and production personnel who make films and videos, many of which are seen worldwide. Over the course of the R.E.A.L. program, students in the Academy’s “<strong>GPA Studios</strong>” course will write, film and direct videos with an opportunity at the end to publish their finished products.

“Mr. DeLuca (middle-school principal) and I are again working with the students on video production,” said, Megan Black, who is the technology and learning specialist for GPA’s middle school. “The student filmmakers already have scripted, storyboarded and filmed their productions and are now in the process of editing their short, narrative films.”

Friday's visit to CCS will help introduce the students to how graphic designers in the “real world” use design, art, and technology to communicate meaningful messages to others.

“Along with learning about the Adobe Creative Cloud suite of design software, each student will work on design planning for a project of their choice, where they can focus on things like digital photography, editorial design, computer graphics, advertising design, and more,” Black added.

Other R.E.A.L. courses at GPA for 2016 include:

-<strong> 8 Mile Zone (8MZ)</strong>, a journalism course that will expose the students to different kinds of journalism — written, television, and radio. Students will be introduced to the importance of solid journalism and some of its more basic techniques, and will discuss journalism in the 21st century to learn more about some of the more important times in history in which journalism played a major part. On the last day of the course, students will try their hands at creating a news piece, which could perhaps be inspired by another GPA R.E.A.L. class. Also, a visit to WDET, Detroit’s public radio station, will highlight the 8MZ experience. There the students will have the opportunity to meet working journalists to discuss their experiences in journalism.

- the <strong>Cryptography</strong> class, which will involve students learning how to send and receive secret messages using both historical and modern methods. Rotation and substitution ciphers, one-time pads, symmetric-key, public-key and steganographic systems will all be explored. In addition, students will learn the basics of code-breaking with hands-on activities. A live video-conferencing session with a cryptographer from the U.S. intelligence community also is planned as a final activity.

- and the <strong>CSI </strong>class, where students will learn crime-scene-analysis techniques, such as document analysis, finger-printing, blood typing, chromatography, tire track evaluation, and footprint analysis. Students also will attempt to identify unknown substances and fibers as well as tool marks and glass fractures. At the end of the course, students will meet with a crime lab scientist and local police.

But if neglected during this period, or frustrated in its vital needs, the mind of the child becomes artificially dulled, henceforth to resist imparted knowledge. Interest will no longer be there if the seed be sown too late, but at six years of age all items of culture are received enthusiastically, and later these seeds will expand and grow.&quot; (from To Educate the Human Potential by Maria Montessori, first published in 1947)</p><p>&quot;There are many who hold, as I do, that the most important period of life is not the age of university studies, but the first one, the period from birth to the age of six. For that is the time when man's intelligence itself, his greatest implement, is being formed. But not only his intelligence; the full totality of his psychic powers.&quot; (from The Absorbent Mind by Maria Montessori, first published in 1952)</p><p>&quot;It begins with a knowledge of his surroundings. How does the child assimilate his environment? He does it solely in virtue of one of those characteristics that we now know him to have. This is an intense and specialized sensitiveness in consequence of which the things about him awaken so much interest and so much enthusiasm that they become incorporated in his very existence . The child absorbs these impressions not with his mind but with his life itself.&quot; (from The Absorbent Mind)</p><p>&quot;We then found that individual activity is the one factor that stimulates and produces development, and that this is not more true for the little ones of preschool age than it is for the junior, middle, and upper school children.&quot; (from The Absorbent Mind)</p><p>Learn more about the Academy&rsquo;s Early School Montessori program <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p><center><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160221161913.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></center><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy officials present the latest portrait of school progress; faculty excellence highlighted</strong>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160223134751.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Lars Kuelling, The Grosse Pointe Academy's head of school, presents his State of the School address in GPA's Tracy Fieldhouse.</strong></em></p><p>Earlier this month, The Grosse Pointe Academy hosted its annual &ldquo;State of the School&rdquo; meeting in the school&rsquo;s Tracy Fieldhouse. Parents, faculty and staff were on hand to listen to Academy Board of Trustees Chair John Murphy and Head of School Lars Kuelling give an update on progress during the past 12 months at the Grosse Pointe Farms private school.&nbsp;</p><p>A special presentation by Academy alum <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=646&amp;page=1&amp;ncat=" target="_blank">James Raudabaugh</a></strong>&nbsp;was one of the highlights of the evening.</p><p>In addition, Jennifer Fauster, chair of the school&rsquo;s head of school search committee, presented an update on potential candidates, and Fred Rollins, a member of the board&rsquo;s finance committee, discussed the school&rsquo;s financial picture.</p><p>Rollins, who noted that the school is in better shape financially than it has been for some time, talked about the gap between tuition and how much it actually costs to educate each child at the Academy.</p><p>&ldquo;The administration and the finance committee of the Board of Trustees have worked diligently to cut costs in all areas that do not directly impact our students learning experience,&rdquo; Rollins said.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160223134829.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Board of Trustees Chair John Murphy addresses parents at the 2016 State of the School event.</strong></em></p><p>He noted that tuition covers about 69% of the cost to educate a GPA student. &ldquo;But that leaves 31% of costs that must be made up elsewhere,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Rollins pointed out that since GPA is a private school and receives no local, state or federal funding help, its primary means to make up the cost gap is by donor support with the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/advancement/31.html" target="_blank">Academy Fund</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/advancement/261.html" target="_blank">Action Auction</a></strong> and endowment transfers.</p><p>He said that a number of factors have contributed of late to the school&rsquo;s positive financial picture, including expense rationalization and proactive cash management; strong donor support for the annual fund and auction; reasonable tuition levels and a prudent investment strategy.</p><p><strong>Faculty excellence</strong></p><p>Head of School Lars Kuelling told those in attendance that there were many positive developments that occurred in terms of academic &ldquo;teaching and learning,&rdquo; and highlighted the ISACS (Independent Schools Association of the Central States) accreditation process that concluded last spring. &nbsp;</p><p>He said the ISACS review team had a number of major commendations for GPA in their final report, including a dedicated, compassionate, flexible and loyal faculty, staff and administration; a &ldquo;family feel&rdquo; that characterizes school community; leadership of the school at the governance level that is intensely focused on the long-term financial sustainability of GPA; and the courage to explore emerging, distinguishing programs like STEAM, 1-to-1 computing, R.E.A.L., and the garden classroom.</p><center><center><center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160223141144.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center></center></center></center><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=646&amp;page=1&amp;ncat=" target="_blank">James Raudabaugh</a>, a 2012 Academy graduate, spoke at GPA's State of the School event.</span></strong></em></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to highlight one of their major commendations for GPA, which to no surprise to anyone here tonight is the quality of our faculty and staff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;ISACS also recommended that we continue to tap into that facility in even stronger ways.&rdquo;</p><p>Kuelling noted that as a result of that recommendation, two things were done almost immediately.</p><p>&ldquo;We established a curriculum-review committee that examines our existing curriculum and makes recommendations for changing and developing it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It makes things a bit more complicated up front, but it recognizes the fact that our experts on curriculum are our faculty.</p><p>&ldquo;Also, we&rsquo;ve given our faculty extra time to work together during the school week and we formalized that process by having &lsquo;late start Thursdays,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of our teachers come in even earlier than they have to, but they now have at least a full hour of collaboration one day each week due to the LSTs. It&rsquo;s been wonderful and it&rsquo;s given them an opportunity to talk about teaching, to talk about students and to talk about how we can grow as a community. I&rsquo;d like to commend the faculty for all their work on this.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Early School wait list</strong></p><p>Another area of the Academy that Kuelling discussed during his address was the success of the Early School.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I can say without equivocation that our <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">Early School Montessori program</a></strong> is the top early school program in the area,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is especially evident to us as we are now filled to the brim with students in Early School. We were full when school opened in the fall and we could not accept another student in the program through the year thus far.&rdquo;</p><p>He also said it appears that for next year, the Early School will again have a wait list.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;This surely points to the fact that in the community, there is a real understanding that this is '<em>the</em>' place to bring a child between the ages of 2-1/2 and kindergarten,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>Personalized education</strong></p><p>Providing more teacher-student time also has been a focus for the Academy during the past year, according to Kuelling. He said that in the area of highly personalized education in grades 1 through 8, the school has made some significant changes to curriculum and staffing.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve added more faculty resources in the areas of reading and math in grades 1 though 3,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which has allowed teachers to spend more time with students. Plus, our middle school math has transitioned to a mastery-based approach.&rdquo;</p><p>In a mastery-based approach to math, according to Kuelling, every student receives the same math curriculum as in years past and every student gets the same material.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But what is different is that it&rsquo;s based on the mastery model, which allows for independent advancement based on mastery of the subject,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So when we took a look at the performance of students at our mid-year assessment, we found that, across the board, students showed improvements against all our benchmarks.&rdquo;</p><p>He said a few students actually demonstrated even more significant mastery of subject, and they were allowed to move to a completely new level, without the usual waiting for other students to catch up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mastery of subject at their own pace,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>Web works</strong></p><p>Kuelling also announced that the Academy will soon roll out a re-tooled website, which in addition to providing more intuitive navigation and easier access to the school calendar, news and curriculum information, will be completely mobile-friendly.</p><p>&ldquo;Most online content is being viewed now on a tablet or phone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With our new site, it automatically adjusts for whatever device you are using to view it.&rdquo;</p><p>He said the new website also makes the administration of content much easier, allowing the school to keep it very fresh and updated.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;But what I really like about the new site are the areas that will allow the viewer to really dig deep into what makes the Academy different,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It really will help us to better communicate the Academy advantage.&rdquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

But we believe all parents should know about this education option, and paying us a visit during our annual open house event will give them a good opportunity to find out.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=621" target="_blank">FIND OUT WHAT CURRENT PARENTS ARE SAYING ABOUT GPA&rsquo;s MONTESSORI EARLY SCHOOL PROGRAM</a></strong></p><p><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160226134656.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p><p><strong>From Montessori to middle school</strong></p><p>Open house attendees also were be able to experience the school&rsquo;s very unique take on technology education, which GPA now calls its &ldquo;STEAM&rdquo; program.</p><p>According to school officials, two years ago the Academy integrated instruction in some of the more traditional STEM subjects such as science, technology and mathematics with classes in art, writing and literature to create the school's own version of a &ldquo;STEAM&rdquo; program, or &quot;science, technology, engineering, arts and math.&quot;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160226134810.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Grosse Pointe Academy middle school students in the R.E.A.L. program spent time last week week at Detroit's College for Creative Studies to learn more about the industrial and graphic design industries.</strong></em></p><div>Along with cutting-edge technology in every classroom at GPA that includes the Grosse Pointes&rsquo; only one-to-one iPad school program for grades one through eight, the integration of the arts and technology has been implemented across the entire spectrum of courses at the Academy, giving all students a continuum of instruction from the Lower School through 8th grade.</div><p>Visitors to the school's March 2 open house also witnessed how GPA teachers are turning Academy students into makers, inventors, engineers, and dreamers in the school's truly &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; Innovation &amp; Design Center, which includes capabilities for robotics, 3D printing and a host of other challenging activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Open house also featured the school&rsquo;s innovative electives program for middle school students. Called &quot;Real-World Experiences and Applied Learning&quot; (R.E.A.L.), these classes &mdash; which exist outside the school's core curriculum &mdash; typically focus on critical thinking and problem-solving activities that require students to propose and create solutions for real-world problems. R.E.A.L. classes in the past have included app design, video production, crime-scene investigation and marketing program design among new ones added each year.</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160229100458.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>The concept of "mastery" for children in the third year of Montessori means that they are applying the skills learned during the first two years and teaching them to others.</strong></em>

This week is Montessori Education Week. It’s also the perfect time to discuss the critical third year of this innovative philosophy of educating young children that was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori more than a hundred years ago.

<strong>Like taking the cake out before it’s finished</strong>

Mastery, autonomy, purpose. Three words that describe what a student finishing up their third-year of Montessori early childhood education will likely take with him or her into the first grade. For this and for many other reasons, educators across the country who are involved with Montessori say it makes little sense to have a child go through pre-school Montessori without following up with the third year: kindergarten Montessori.

“It’s like taking the cake out before it’s finished,” says Martha Haakmat, head of school at Brooklyn Heights Montessori School in Brooklyn, New York.

“It’s a three-year cycle,” says Munir Shivji, director of primary programs at Cambridge Montessori School in Cambridge, Mass. “The first year is like planting a seed, the second year is watering and the stem comes and the leaves come, and the third year is when you see the beautiful flower.”

<em>(In the video below, see more of what Montessori educators in the U.S. are saying about this “essential” year of Montessori.)</em>

Michelle Morrison, head of school at Princeton Montessori School in Princeton, New Jersey, adds that at the end of the three-year program, “what we’re really hoping for in Montessori is that we’ve left the child with a sense of wonder, a sense of confidence and an attitude that will take them forward in their lives.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Transplant from Switzerland and GPA language instructor says Academy was the only choice for her own children</strong>

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160301140920.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>Claudia Leslie, who has been the Academy’s Early School - grade 5 French instructor for more than 10 years, said that when it came time for her own daughters to begin their early education, she and her husband, Stephen Leslie, quickly found out there was only one way to go. Claudia then was teaching French and German in the Grosse Pointe Public Schools system.

“When it was time to enroll our oldest daughter in a preschool, we started exploring the preschools in Grosse Pointe,” Leslie said. “But it became quickly evident to us that The Grosse Pointe Academy would provide our young daughters with the best education in Grosse Pointe, so we enrolled them in the Montessori program at the Academy.”

After eleven years at GPA, those daughters, Léonie (18) and Sophie (15), are now well on their way to successful paths in furthering their education careers, said mom.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank"><strong>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE ACADEMY’S MONTESSORI EARLY SCHOOL PROGRAM HERE.</strong></a>

While her children’s educational journey so far has been confined pretty much to the Grosse Pointe area, Claudia Leslie’s own education career spans two continents. Born and raised with her five siblings in the canton of Bern, Switzerland, Leslie grew up with a real appreciation of the importance of education. Fluency in more than one language also was a very normal thing for her and her childhood peers.

“When you grow up in Switzerland, it's normal to speak multiple languages on a daily basis,” she said. “Switzerland actually has four official languages, German, French, Italian and Romansh, and in Bern, the predominant languages are German and French.”

<strong>Career in education forgone conclusion</strong>

She said that Switzerland is renowned worldwide for its school system and at an early age, she became focused on a career in education — a very early age.

“I actually knew I wanted to become a teacher since kindergarten,” she said, “and I followed that dream by ultimately receiving my teaching certification from the Teachers Training College of Bern.”

<center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160301145022.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></center><em><strong>French teacher Claudia Leslie says small class sizes at the Academy is advantageous in the language learning process, especially for children in the lower grades.</strong></em>

After college, Leslie taught for three years in Switzerland during which time — on a two-month visit to Michigan to further improve her English-language skills — she met Stephen, eventually married, and permanently moved across the Atlantic to Grosse Pointe to make a new home where her husband grew up.

In 2004, after a number of years teaching in the Grosse Pointe Public Schools, Leslie left GPPS to become the Early School-through-grade 5 French instructor at The Grosse Pointe Academy. She said she appreciates the family atmosphere at the Academy and truly loves her job there, especially since she can continue teaching a subject near and dear to her heart.

“Because I grew up in a bilingual environment, I believe that's why world languages have always been a passion of mine,” Leslie said. “Knowing multiple languages can be very empowering when you travel and you actually can communicate well with people from other countries. In fact, every summer, my parents would take my siblings and me to different countries in Europe where we learned to appreciate other languages and cultures. I also think that's why I enjoy traveling so much with the GPA students when they go to Europe.”

Leslie, Amal El-Hosni, who teaches middle school French at the Academy, and Head of School Lars Kuelling recently returned from what is becoming an annual event: a weeklong trip with middle-school students to Spain and France. “For me it's like going home again and showing the kids what I’ve experienced when I was their age,” Leslie said. “I love to explore the world!”

<strong>Small class size key</strong>

She said that exploring the world through language also is an important part of how she approaches teaching at GPA and adds that class size is so critical in that approach.

“The small class sizes at the Academy allow me to nurture the potential of each child, which allows the students to more quickly discover their unique strengths and passions,” she said. “I make sure that each student gets plenty of opportunities to speak French during the class. I truly believe that giving a child the opportunity to learn French at an early age is a great advantage because they acquire it in a natural manner. In addition, I think it’s an effort that provides them with a deeper understanding of one's own language and a broader global awareness.”

Leslie’s own efforts with the children certainly do not go unnoticed at the Academy, said Jennifer Kendall, assistant head of school for Early School education and admissions.

“It is a tremendous benefit at GPA to offer French starting at age 2-1/2 in the Montessori Early School and Madame Leslie is such a gift to the children,” Kendall said. “So often I hear them speaking French just like ‘Madame Leslie.’ They all want to sound like her and we often see and hear the benefits of that early learning experience as they continue with French through grade 5 and for those who take French through grade 8.”

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160301141042.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Claudia Leslie is with her husband, Stephen, on a recent trip to Europe.</strong></em>

There’s no doubt that Leslie’s students have benefited from all the time she has spent on the Academy campus for all these years. But whenever she’s away from campus, Leslie said she still keeps herself very busy.

“When I'm not teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends as well as skiing, running, biking, sailing and hiking among many other activities that occupy my time,” she said. “Also, I'm the youngest of six children, and my siblings and father all still live in Switzerland. So my family and I always look forward to visiting them each summer.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-ultimate-csv-importer/images/noimage.png" /> may be said that in order to develop the imagination it is necessary for everyone first of all to put himself in contact with reality.&rdquo; - Dr. Maria Montessori</em></p><p>When Dr. Montessori opened her first classroom in 1907 in the San Lorenzo tenement housing in Rome, she had two cabinets of materials for the children&rsquo;s use. One was filled with the materials she had designed and made for the children based on her earlier work in hospitals, and the other was filled with toys that had been donated to her by her friends.</p><p>Dr. Montessori found very quickly that the children in the classroom exclusively chose the materials over the toys. She was surprised, and went so far as to sit down with the children and show them how to use the toys. After sitting with the dolls and so on for a short time, the children returned to the materials and remained with them. This observation brought Montessori to the conclusion that the children preferred reality and real work to toys and fantasy. Her conclusion has since been supported both by Montessori&rsquo;s own work and that of many educators the world over.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160303113223.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>I have found myself wondering on occasion if such a scenario could still take place. Surely contemporary battery-powered toys with flashing lights and a different song for every button would attract attention away from our simple, orderly materials. But I have seen that it is not so.</p><p>A year or so ago, my school hosted a fundraising garage sale. We filled part of a classroom not being used for the summer with donations. We had all kinds of things &ndash; plastic play kitchen sets, a cat-shaped keyboard, toy cars, dolls, a bin of dress-up clothes, bikes, and the list goes on. The other half of the classroom still had Montessori materials neatly arranged on shelves.</p><p>I watched as a two-and-a-half year old girl walked into the room, looked at all the toys, even touching some of them, and went straight to the shelves of materials and took great delight in working with a cylinder block (one of the Montessori sensorial materials). She was not prompted in any way, nor did I put her in the room as a test or experiment. She was not a student at our school returning to the familiar joys of the classroom. She was a child entering into a room filled with choices and after seeing what was available, she chose what she wanted (or needed) most.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160303113252.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p>Often in Montessori, we speak of the materials calling out to the children, and we do our best to make sure that call is clear. That is why our classrooms tend to be simple and uncluttered, decorated to the point of orderly beauty, not to the point of distraction. The children want to engage in the classroom. They want the experience that the materials will give them because they will get more learning from that experience than from flashy toys or reasoned rhetoric from an adult.</p><p>I think this story supports several truths about children, but the thought I want to land on today is that children crave reality. They want to do real work with real things. Nearly every parent of a two or three-year-old child sympathizes with the image of sweeping the floor and having to drag the child along on the end of the broom. The children want to help, they want to understand their own power to do work, and they will be best satisfied in that quest when they have real things to do.</p><p><strong>About the author</strong></p><p>Paul Gutting has been the executive director at St. Charles, Missouri-based Campbell Montessori School since 2011.

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[In an article originally posted on MariaMontessori.com, the head of a Missouri Montessori school discusses how children as young as 2-1/2 years old most often pick Montessori classroom materials over more conventional toys when given a choice. It is proof once again of the central tenet of the Montessori philosophy that says education, especially for the very young, cultivates a child's intrinsic desire to learn.]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the Academy's educational goals is to prepare students through sound moral teachings to become effective leaders, responsible citizens, and caring stewards. In addition to special classes for Grades 1 through 8 that introduce and discuss religions from around the world, Monday morning chapel assemblies help GPA students develop a reverence for all people and incorporate strong moral and ethical values in his or her life.</p><p>These weekly chapel assemblies also provide an opportunity for an Academy faculty or staff member to speak to the students on a wide range of subjects and topics.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160308105006.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Sasha Murphy, who is an Academy alum, has been teaching at her alma mater since 1998. Read more about Murphy </strong></em><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=542" target="_blank"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a><em><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>Yesterday, March 7, Sasha Murphy, who is a phys-ed teacher, community-service coordinator and NJHS/student council advisor at the Academy, spoke to those present on what it means to be a student at GPA and then to fully embrace that identity with pride &mdash; and with &ldquo;awesomeness.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>We are. . .</strong></p><p>By Sasha Murphy</p><p>Who are we? Who is GPA as a school? Sounds like a simple question, right? But can you put it into five or six sentences? I can&rsquo;t. I tried. Luckily, I have a whole chapel and more than a couple minutes to talk about who we are and why we are awesome.</p><p>Phil DeMartini, a former head of school here at GPA once said, &ldquo;We are put-the-shopping-cart-back type of people.&rdquo; That saying has stuck with me for years. We put the shopping cart back in the store or into the cart corral after we use it. Not because it's the law or that we are required to do it, but because it's the right thing to do. We borrowed something that is not ours and hen we return it.&nbsp;</p><p>We are helpers. Students, teachers and parents jump in to help when someone gets injured or feels sick. We help students clean up when they drop their lunch tray or spill their water bottle. We help each other carry heavy items or run errands for teachers. We pick up trash we find outside and throw it away. We help each other with school work. We wipe down the lunch tables after we eat. We are always there to help one another.&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160308105714.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>Murphy speaks to GPA students at the March 7 chapel assembly.</strong></em></p><p>We open doors for others, without being asked. Not just for fellow students, but for teachers, parents and visitors. I've seen this happen here at school, on field trips, and out in the community when I run into teachers, students and their families.</p><p>We are polite and respectful all... over... the... world. Not just here at school, but while away at Camp Storer, in Cleveland, Mackinac Island, Chicago, and even France and Spain! We are respectful of the people we are meeting and in every environment we find ourselves in or are visiting.&nbsp;</p><p>We are a group of teachers and students who care. I bet everyone in here has had a bad day. I know I have. I also bet you had numerous people try to cheer you up, try to help you, or give you a hug or smile.&nbsp;</p><p>We are a super fun place. It all begins with the back-to-school picnic in September. From there we move on to birthday and holiday celebrations, field trips, recess time, class activities, dances, spirit week and, of course, the teachers-versus-middle-school-students dodge ball game. We end the year with very cool trips to the park to swim, picnic, fish and hang out with our classmates.&nbsp;</p><p>We are doers. We participate in community service. We travel. We play sports. We cook. We pray. We study hard. We play music. We know technology. We have become gardeners. We try our best. We... do... it... all.</p><p>We say hello to others as we enter the room or pass them on the street or in the hallway. We say please, thank you, you're welcome, I'm sorry, have a nice day and goodbye.</p><p>We are athletes. We play soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, lacrosse, hockey and baseball. We compete in dance, ballet, swimming, football, golf and horse back riding shows. We are runners, skiers, and snowboarders. We test at various levels for martial arts. We race in sailing regattas all over the country.&nbsp;</p><p>And once you graduate from GPA, you are still one of us. If you are like Mrs. Jerome, Mr. De Luca or myself, you even come back to teach here. Other GPA graduates are doctors, lawyers, teachers, coaches, nurses, professional athletes, business owners, musicians, tech experts, artists, mothers, fathers, engineers, authors and pretty much every other career you can think of. Why? Because we are awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>Now here&rsquo;s a little shout-out to all my fellow teachers. I think we are pretty amazing. We love our students and care about them unconditionally. We challenge ourselves in order to help challenge our students. We work hard. We will do pretty much anything to help our students feel successful. We &mdash; well not me personally &mdash; but Mr. Cowan, Mrs. Jerome and Mr. De Luca have even climbed three-story towers and hung from a three-story-high ropes course. GPA teachers dress up as pigs and keep ducks in their classrooms &mdash; all for the sake of learning. We are GPA.</p><p>Students, you are simply awesome! You are funny, smart, outgoing, caring, genuine, thoughtful, motivated, uplifting and give the best hugs and smiles. You are GPA.</p><p>As you return to your classes this morning, you will find a Bulldog-blue &ldquo;I AM GPA&rdquo; pencil waiting for you. When you use it, think of all the awesome things that come along with those initials &ldquo;GPA.&rdquo;</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p><div><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></div><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because last week was Montessori Education Week and since this week we celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day (March 8),&nbsp;we thought it was a good time to republish an article that focuses on perhaps the world's most famous female educator, Maria Montessori, who, according to the article&rsquo;s author, reframed conventional thinking about the relationship between play and learning.</p><p>More from The Grosse Pointe Academy on this topic is available <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=659&amp;page=1&amp;ncat=" target="_blank">here</a></strong>, and more information on the Academy&rsquo;s Montessori Early School can be found <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/studentlife/10.html" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160309110243.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><p><em><strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy offers Michigan's longest continuously running Montessori program.</strong></em></p><hr /><p><strong>How Maria Montessori can help us get past the false debate between work and play</strong></p><p>By Maureen Kelleher (Posted: March 7, 2016, on educationpost.org)</p><p><em>Maureen Kelleher is a Chicago charter school parent and veteran education writer. Her work has appeared in Education Week and Catalyst Chicago.</em></p><p>A false debate rages among parents and even educators these days: play versus academic content. While there&rsquo;s no question academic expectations for our youngest learners have risen over the last 20 years, there are lots of good questions being asked about how we&rsquo;re changing their classroom experiences to meet the new demands.</p><p>We all know that kindergarten is the new first grade and we&rsquo;re arguing over whether Common Core is appropriate for the youngest students. But those arguments can get pretty muddy. Charges that increased academic demands crowd out time for free play, get mixed up with the criticism that we&rsquo;re teaching young kids with worksheets rather than hands-on learning experiences. Both aren&rsquo;t good, but they are different problems, with different solutions.</p><p>What&rsquo;s real in all this is bad classroom practice&mdash;testing kindergartners, pushing down sit still, kill-and-drill worksheets as the way to learn reading and math. But what&rsquo;s false is to say that play is separate from mastering academic knowledge and skills.</p><p><strong>From patients to students</strong></p><p>Just in time for International Women&rsquo;s Day (March 8), there was an inspiring woman educator whom we can look to in order to help us reframe our thinking about play and learning: Maria Montessori.</p><p>Montessori, Italy&rsquo;s first woman doctor, became deeply interested in children&rsquo;s learning after observing firsthand the native intelligence of poor and working-class children whom she treated as a doctor and whose abilities Italian society seriously underestimated. She began to develop her methods while running a school for developmentally disabled children and closely observing their progress. In 1907, the Italian government supported her in opening a school for 60 working-class Italian children ages 1 to 6.</p><p>Some people might be surprised to hear Montessori referenced in a discussion about play. There&rsquo;s a common misconception out there that the Montessori method discourages pretend play because Montessori classrooms don&rsquo;t contain play kitchens or toys or dress-up areas. The reality is much more complicated.</p><p>First off, why pretend to cook in a play kitchen when you can work with real food in a real one? Chopping vegetables, caring for plants, cleaning windows, washing dishes&mdash;preschoolers and early elementary students find these activities deeply interesting and fun. And they can do them, given appropriately-sized tools. They are essential parts of the &ldquo;practical life&rdquo; component of the Montessori curriculum.</p><p>As one Montessori teacher/blogger has described her classroom, she sees constant examples of dramatic play going on while children are engaged with books, a real stethoscope, even cutting paper. Interestingly, in Montessori&rsquo;s view, imagination becomes even more important when children reach elementary school. By then they have achieved sufficient understanding of the real world to allow them to better distinguish imagination from reality and to use imagination to help them understand abstract concepts from the Big Bang to plate tectonics and more.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s our problem?</strong></p><p>If Maria Montessori were alive today, I bet she&rsquo;d say our biggest problems aren&rsquo;t arguing over how much time students should have for recess. She&rsquo;d wonder why we draw such a bright line between what happens in preschool&mdash;where experiential, hands-on learning still has a fighting chance&mdash;and what happens in those kindergartens where they not only took the toys out, but also made the teachers the center of the action, not the children.</p><p>She&rsquo;d wonder why so many of our elementary classrooms aren&rsquo;t set up for children to choose their own learning activities, including moving around to take them out and put them away. She would decry our age-in-grade lockstep and wonder why we were so inflexible about multi-age groupings.</p><p>In an age when we&rsquo;ve gotten better at teaching our children the basics of reading but haven&rsquo;t yet put as much energy into increasing their general knowledge&mdash;especially in science and social studies&mdash;Maria Montessori&rsquo;s methods and materials offer a useful third way between inappropriate, didactic instruction and calls for more unstructured play as a panacea for all the bad practice evident in young children&rsquo;s classrooms.</p><p>For those who think Montessori&rsquo;s choice of the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;play&rdquo; to describe children&rsquo;s activities meant she was a killjoy, she also left us an interesting benchmark by which to evaluate the quality of our practices: &ldquo;One test of the correctness of educational procedure is the happiness of the child.&rdquo;</p><p><a class="a2a_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share_save" style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /><img alt="Share" border="0" height="16" rel="lightbox" src="//static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_106_16.png" width="106" /></a></p><div><strong>About The Grosse Pointe Academy<br /></strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy is an independent, coeducational day school serving children age 2-1/2 through Grade 8.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>In photo above, Academy eighth-grader Maria Fields, left, is with middle-school social studies and language arts teacher, Harriett Whitaker, and the trophy Fields earned March 12 at the WXYZ-Scripps Spelling Bee.</em>
<p style="text-align: left;">After eight grueling rounds of increasingly difficult words to spell, The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Maria Fields came home as the overall winner of the annual WXYZ-Scripps Spelling Bee, which was held March 12.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Her winning word was “stratocracy,” and the word that propelled her into the final round was “endotracheal.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fields now will move on to the 89th annual Scripps National Spelling Bee, which is scheduled for May 24-26, 2016, in Oxon Hill, Maryland.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>About the Scripps National Spelling Bee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the nation’s largest and longest-running educational program, the Scripps National Spelling Bee has proven itself as more than a competition for children; it has become a classic element of Americana. Last year’s primetime competition on ESPN led to the Bee being the most tweeted show of the week.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Grosse Pointe Academy fourth-grade teacher says her students continue to amaze her.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/deboer_bd4a6333_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28025"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-28025" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/deboer_bd4a6333_1200px-1024x819.jpg" alt="deboer_bd4a6333_1200px" width="1024" height="819" /></a>

Last week, during The Grosse Pointe Academy’s open house, STEAM and art fair, a certain teacher was trying to keep a watchful eye or two on a college basketball game that was streaming on her computer all the while she was engaging Academy visitors.

It wasn’t just any college basketball game. It was a Patriot League tournament contest between GPA fourth-grade teacher Didi DeBoer’s daughter's team, Bucknell, and Lafayette. Claire DeBoer, a junior on the Bison squad, is the team’s second-leading scorer.

“I can’t help it," Didi DeBoer said. “I am so competitive. I just want my daughter’s team to win!”

Bucknell did win the game, 68-59, and eventually landed in the league’s semifinal game on March 11 that saw Claire DeBoer finish with a team-high 15 points in a loss to Loyola Maryland.

<strong>High standards</strong>

DeBoer’s own competitiveness and will to do well seem to come naturally to her whether it’s on the court or in the classroom.

“She sets very high standards for herself and for those she teaches,” said Academy third-grade teacher Beth Ahee, who has known DeBoer and her family for more than 20 years. “Whatever she does, she does well — just look at the garden and the Innovation Station she began. You don't meet many teachers as dedicated as Didi.”

DeBoer says GPA students are "such happy children and really love school. They definitely are the reason I love teaching."

Along with her classroom duties, DeBoer also coaches the Academy’s girls basketball team. She said she loves sports and can usually be found playing one or watching another.

“I’m a huge fan of basketball and [obviously] love watching my daughter play,” she said. “I'm also a big college football fan. My husband, John, and son, David, both played football and David now coaches at the college level. I play a ton of golf in the summer and enjoy tennis very much as well.”

But it’s in the classroom that DeBoer gets the most satisfaction.

“By far, the most important part of my job is the students,” she said. “They make me laugh and inspire me each day. My mission is to reach each child individually where they are in the learning process and hopefully inspire them each day as well. And, of course. make them laugh along the way. I want my students to LOVE 4th grade; it's a really big deal to me!”

<strong>Teaching wasn't first job</strong>

The desire to become a teacher while growing up also was a big deal to DeBoer, she said, but her path to a career in education took a short detour when she began college.

“I always wanted to be a teacher, but when I attended college for the first time, the teaching market wasn't going so well, so I went into business instead,” she said. “My first degree was a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Central Michigan University. But after working in business for a few years, I realized all over again that my first love was teaching, so while I was home raising my children, I went back to college to become a teacher.”

DeBoer’s teaching degree is from Saginaw Valley State University where she majored in math and science. She later returned to SVSU for her master’s in elementary education.

But GPA was not her first teaching job, however. DeBoer taught in Warren and Mt. Clemens, and was an occasional sub in the Grosse Pointe Public Schools, but her desire to land a full-time job in her hometown eventually came to fruition six years ago when she hired in at The Grosse Pointe Academy.

“Coming here was so very joyful for me,” she said. “My first impression of GPA was that the students were amazing! They are such happy children and really love school. They definitely are the reason I love teaching.”

DeBoer says that even after six years at the school, the students at GPA still amaze her. And so does the school.

DeBoer and Megan Black, who is technology and learning specialist at the Academy, are co-coordinators for the school’s STEAM activity.

“The Academy has really changed in the past six years,” she said. “We have become a school that is on the forefront, technological speaking, which is amazing. Also, our focus on STEAM education is a tremendously positive change that I enjoy being part of. Our garden classroom has been such a welcome addition as well. It has really opened up our learning opportunities and is one more reason out of many that GPA is unique and special.”

When asked what she might be if she wasn’t a teacher, DeBoer hesitates.

“I love being a teacher so thinking of myself in any other job is difficult,” she said. “When I retire from teaching, I look forward to going on mission trips and helping others. So, I guess I could say that being a volunteer and helping others is what I would choose if I wasn’t a teacher.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>For an Academy 8th grader, her mailbox at home brings five big letters; she joins long list of current and former GPA students accepted to prestigious schools</strong>

<center><center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160316175949.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center></center><strong><em>Grosse Pointe Academy 8th-grader Nafi Sall will be attending Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts when school starts in the fall.</em></strong>

It’s the time of the school year when most high school seniors are looking beyond graduation to the next step in their academic career: college. So too are most 8th graders looking forward to their next academic stop, which for them usually is in an area high school.

But for some in 8th grade, they are looking somewhere else completely at this time of the year: the mailbox. That's because it’s usually around February or March when most of the nation’s more prominent boarding schools send acceptance letters to prospective student applicants.

For one of those students, Grosse Pointe Academy 8th-grader Nafissatou (Nafi) Sall, her "mailbox-looking" turned up five boarding school acceptance letters. Which is quite a feat for any student. But in Sall’s case, she only applied to five — Deerfield Academy, Choate Rosemary Hall, Peddie School, The Lawrenceville School and Loomis Chaffee School — all of which appear on numerous listings of the top 20 boarding schools in America.

“Five for five!” was the excited comment from Assistant Head of School for Instruction and Grades 1-8 Principal Lawrence DeLuca after finding out from Sall’s mother, Erica Thrash-Sall, that Nafi received her fifth acceptance letter — from Choate, which also offered Sall the “Paul Mellon ’25 Scholars” scholarship, which specifically is for students of strong character who have demonstrated academic excellence and drive in the study of math, computer science, and/or science.

<strong>Crane Scholarships aplenty</strong>

DeLuca said there have been a number of Academy students over the years who have been accepted to and received scholarships from the nation’s more elite schools. He said many also receive scholarships and acceptances to Cranbrook Kingswood in Bloomfield Hills, including current GPA 8th graders Maria Fields and Isabella Tomlinson.

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160316172105.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" />

“Our students are accepted to the best schools in metro Detroit and across the country,” DeLuca said. “Last year, our students attended 11 different high schools, and it looks like that number will be very similar this year. Coming to The Grosse Pointe Academy really is a great choice for parents as our students consistently gain acceptance to the high schools of their choice.”

Beside Fields and Tomlinson, who also earned a full-ride scholarship to University Liggett, DeLuca said recent GPA grads McCalla Mecke, Piero Cavataio and Joseph Cavataio received the prestigious merit-based Crane Scholarship from Cranbrook. Plus, he said, current 8th-grader Brooke Popadich has been accepted to Choate, The Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, and is currently wait-listed at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, a school that typically accepts less than 10 percent of applicants.

For Nafi Sall, however, she says she’s decided to definitely head east in the fall to attend Deerfield, a boarding school located a few hours outside of Boston. Deerfield routinely accepts only 13 percent of its applicants, which is 78 percent lower than the average for all secondary boarding schools. The school also says its incoming students typically score 87% on the SSAT and score an average of 2000 on the SAT, which is 15 percent higher than the average for all boarding schools in the U.S.

<strong>‘I knew it was for me’</strong>

Even though Deerfield, Mass., is a long way from Grosse Pointe Farms, Sall said she will never forget her time at the Academy, which for her began in the 3rd grade.

“I will truly miss the Grosse Pointe Academy,” Sall said. “I started GPA six years ago, and the minute I set foot into the school, I knew it was just for me. GPA has such a friendly and open environment, and provides so many opportunities for each student to grow. I have become the person I was born to be because of GPA and I am utterly grateful for these past years.

“I have learned how to be a leader, how to work with my classmates and how to work to my potential,” she added.

Her mother, Erica Thrash-Sall, is equally grateful for the future potential the Academy has brought not only to Nafi, but to her son, Amadou, a current sixth grader at the Academy.

“Having our children attend The Grosse Pointe Academy is one of the best decisions that we’ve ever made,” Erica said. “The teachers have been wonderful. They truly care about the students and they recognize and encourage their strengths.”

She said she especially loves how GPA concentrates on developing the whole child, whether it be academically, artistically, physically and spiritually.

“The R.E.A.L. electives, school trips and experiences with speakers sharing expert knowledge in the classroom are enrichment experiences that my children will never forget,” she said.

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160316170652.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center><em><strong>Sall, second from right, was one of three GPA 8th graders to recently win the annual America &amp; Me essay contest sponsored by Farm Bureau Insurance. Pictured with Sall, from left, are language arts teacher Bridgette Murray, Shekinah Aho, Tierney Janovsky and Farm Bureau Insurance agent Colleen Dryer.</strong></em>

She also thinks the relationships that her family has built up with other families in the school community have been very important during their time at GPA.

“The school community is strong and and it has made my children feel so supported,” she said. “My children have a lot of school spirit and are very proud to attend GPA. They value the education and appreciate all of the opportunities that they have had at GPA.”

<strong>'Amazing teacher, amazing person'</strong>

Certainly, it’s way too early to have definite career goals yet, but Nafi Sall still has some idea of how she wants to spend her life after finishing college. “I plan to explore careers in the field of science because I am passionate about biology and chemistry,” she said, and it’s pretty clear she holds one particular teacher at the Academy responsible for that passion.

“While I have truly enjoyed all of my teachers at The Grosse Pointe Academy and I have felt supported and encouraged by all of them, my chemistry teacher, cross country coach and former math teacher, Mrs. Michelle Roberts, has been a role model, mentor, and one of my favorite teachers of all time. She is caring, helpful, and not just an amazing teacher, but an amazing person.”

<strong>Bittersweet time of the year</strong>

GPA principal DeLuca said that for the school community, it’s usually bittersweet when eighth graders finally graduate in the spring.

“It’s always tough to see such great kids leave, but at the same time, it’s such a great feeling to know that they leave with all of the tools necessary to fully succeed at the next level.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Montessori school in Hawaii gets big help from rock and roller</strong>

<center><img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20160318164139.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></center>Visitors typically marvel at the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/aboutus/183.html?nid=615" target="_blank">architectural splendor</a></strong> and lake-side setting that identifies the Academy.

Whether it’s the school’s beautiful rolling grounds, its historic Gothic-inspired exterior or its bright and modern educational facilities inside, the Academy occupies a very unique position in elementary — and Montessori — education.

You really have to look far and wide to find another Montessori elementary school in such a splendid setting. And so we did. In fact, we looked more than 4,000 miles west to our country’s 50th state to find such a school. And though a planned expansion is not quite completely built yet, and the construction materials may not be brick and limestone, the setting appears to be as postcard-friendly as the Academy’s. Plus, a student garden is in the works!

Montessori Hale O Keiki School, which is located in Hawaii and like GPA serves preschool through 8th grade students, wanted to grow and secure land to call its own. But that was easier said than done. After pursuing nine different properties over the years that never quite worked out, school leaders learned about 14 ocean-side acres for sale in Ukumehame on the island of Maui.

But this was no ordinary seller. Check out the video below.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Love of learning and appreciation for the world came from the Academy, says 1980 grad</strong>

When The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Class of 2016 graduates from 8th grade in June, an alumna chosen to speak at the commencement ceremony will very likely present her thoughts on education at the next level and how life will be changing for the soon-to-be high schoolers. But we suspect a great deal of her talk will also center on how deeply affected she was by her own education at the Academy.

Megan Bonanni, a 1980 Academy alum and civil rights attorney, who late last year was honored as one of 30 members of the prestigious Class of 2015 “Women in the Law” group, has been chosen as one of the speakers at the Academy graduation to be held June 14 on the school’s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.

In a phone interview this week, Bonanni became a bit overwhelmed when she began to reminisce and talk about her days at the Academy.

“Just thinking about the Academy makes me want to cry,” she said, clearly emotional. “But in a great way.”

She thinks her grade-school was a game changer that led directly to her doing so well in high school, college and law school, and that also gave her the drive she needed to become a successful attorney.

“I have to say it was that unique approach to education at the Academy, the very individualized approach that emboldened all of us,” she said. “Every child. . . we all felt like the world was our oyster. It made learning fun and definitely helped to boost our self confidence, which was critical for us at that age.”

Bonanni currently is partner at Pitt McGehee Palmer &amp; Rivers PC, a Royal Oak firm that specializes in employment law, civil rights, personal injury and criminal defense.

Her “Women in the Law” honor last year was preceded by recognition as one of the “Best Lawyers in America” and a rating by Crain’s Detroit Business as one of the leaders in her field. And, in 2011, she was recognized by The American Lawyer publication as a national “Top Lawyer.”

In addition to specializing in civil rights and employment law for Pitt McGehee, Bonanni, who received her law degree from Wayne State University, volunteers as an attorney and speaker with the Epilepsy Foundation and as a mentor with the Women Lawyers Association of Michigan. She also helped co-sponsor and build homes in Mexico as part of a Jimmy Carter work project through Habitat for Humanity. She is a member of the Michigan Association for Justice, National Employment Lawyers Association, State Bar of Michigan, the Women Lawyers Association of Michigan and serves as chair of the Federal Bar Association Trial Practice and Tactics Sub-Committee.

Fluent in French, Bonanni credits the Academy not only for that second language, which she also studied in college, but with a life-long appreciation for the world and the people of the world.

“Back when I was at GPA, we didn’t go overseas like they do now for class trips, but because of my social studies and French classes, I started to see my world as a much larger place,” she said. “I remember that’s when I put a map in my closet at home, and started putting pushpins in the countries I wanted to visit when I grew up. Now I’ve already visited most if not all of them. So I’m quite sure this need and desire I have to see the world was because of my early experience at the Academy.”

She attended law school at Wayne State University. Prior to becoming a lawyer, she lived in France for several years attending the University of Caen and working at a post-baccalaureate business school in Strasbourg.[/caption]

She also says it was because of the Academy that she went through a foreign studies program in Kalamazoo College, which led to a two-year stint teaching at a business college in Strasbourg, France. She said practicing law was not on her radar then, but now that she is an attorney, it kind of makes sense, especially since she specializes in civil rights law.

“In the Academy at the time, and in my class especially, there were kids from every walk of life, with very diverse cultural backgrounds,” she recalls. “We were diverse racially and diverse socioeconomically. There were rich kids. There were poor kids. A very, very diverse group of students, who while we were all quite different, never noticed any of those differences.”

She said her friends from the Academy in the heart of Grosse Pointe were the most diverse group of people that you can imagine.

“And the fact that I’m a civil rights lawyer now. . .I think there’s a real connection there. It all makes sense now.”

When Bonanni speaks to this year’s graduating class, it will be full-circle for her, as she also was chosen to speak at her own graduation ceremony in 1980. She’s not sure yet what specifically she will talk about at this year’s ceremony, but she hopes it will be at least partly inspirational for the 2016 grads.

“I consider it a real honor to be chosen to speak at such an important event. The years I spent at the Academy were some of the best years of my life. The kindness of everyone while I was there and the constant boosting of our self-esteem, and the fact that the teachers made learning so much fun was something that I will carry throughout my entire life.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1982 Academy graduate says well-run Mariners Inn is a ‘life changer’</strong>

Academy alum Michael French ('82) recently was honored for his volunteer work with Mariners Inn.
Nineteen-eighty-two Grosse Pointe Academy alum Michael French is a successful businessman operating in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries. But it’s his extracurricular work with a Detroit nonprofit that this University of New Hampshire graduate is most proud of.

French is first vice president on the executive board at Mariners Inn, which is based in downtown Detroit about a block from Cass Tech High School. When ground was broken in 1994 for the current Mariners headquarters, French was on hand because the “Dainforth Baker French Building" was named for his father, who along with Michael's grandfather had a substantial part in getting the facility financed and built.

In a blog post published recently by the Mariners Inn organization, Erica N. Rakowicz writes about Michael French and how he is carrying on his family’s legacy at what in 2013 was named one of Crain's Detroit Business magazine's "Best-Managed Nonprofits."

<hr />

<strong>SUPPORTER SPOTLIGHT: MICHAEL FRENCH, MARINERS INN BOARD MEMBER</strong>

Erica N. Rakowicz

Michael French, a three-year-and-counting member of the board at Mariners Inn, was first introduced to the establishment in 1994.

French’s father passed away in 1990 and French remembers going to a groundbreaking ceremony and unveiling of the Dainforth Baker French building, named after his father, at Mariners Inn.

French’s grandfather donated funds in order to build the Dainforth Baker French building at Mariners Inn and ever since, Mariners Inn has been an organization that French has always kept in mind. About four years ago, French was driving downtown with his kids and he drove past the building and told his kids the history of it.

“They said it was the coolest thing they’d ever seen,” French said. After seeing their reaction and thinking more on it himself, French decided it was time to get involved.

“It was a way for me to carry on the legacy of my dad,” French said.
French's family was instrumental in the building of the Mariners Inn headquarters in downtown Detroit.

As a board member and volunteer, French is most proud of the missions at Mariners Inn, including the mission of reconnecting fathers with their families.

“It’s right in the heart of Detroit and we need to ride the wave of this resurgence in Detroit and it needs to be complemented by helping those who are so critical to helping the rebirth of Detroit,” French said of the organization. “Who better to focus in on that the fathers?”

Around the holidays, Mariners Inn engages in many giving back initiatives, one of which is spearheaded by the residents themselves. The Adopt-A-Family program at Mariners Inn came to be after a group of residents decided they would give back to the community that gives back to them.

French said the enormity of an act like that is amazing and it’s his favorite time of year. His favorite part of the festivities is watching families open their gifts while they’re enjoying a luncheon with Mariners Inn.

“We need strong families in Detroit and Mariners is a key component,” French said.

<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/alumni-highlight-a-big-year-for-the-academy/" target="_blank">READ MORE ABOUT GROSSE POINTE ACADEMY ALUMNI HERE</a></strong>

French spends his free time going to sports games downtown with his family and sampling all the new restaurants in town. He also likes to get the word out about Mariners Inn whenever he can to friends, family and strangers alike.

There’s a sort of passion that’s hard to explain bouncing around the halls of Mariners Inn, French said, and he believes it’s contagious.

“You kind of get bit by the Mariners bug,” he said. “Get involved. All it takes is to walk in the doors of Mariners Inn, take a quick tour around and it’s a life changer.

<strong>More about Mariners Inn:</strong>

Founded in 1925 by the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan, Mariners Inn is a nationally acclaimed, licensed, full-service treatment center providing substance abuse treatment, shelter, and supportive services to Southeast Michigan’s homeless men.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Award also includes full-tuition for four years </strong>

Academy eight-grader Isabella Tomlinson recently was named a Liggett Merit Scholar by University Liggett School in Grosse Pointe Woods. This highly competitive scholarship, which is announced by Liggett each spring, is based on academic achievement, teacher recommendations, interviews, writing samples, test scores and overall potential impact on the Liggett community, drew applicants from throughout the region.

Tomlinson, who lives in Harrison Township, joins five other area students who earned the scholarship, which includes a full- or half-tuition award for four years at Liggett’s upper school. Tomlinson’s scholarship is for full tuition.

A press release issued by Liggett late last month calls Tomlinson an outstanding student and model citizen.

“Isabella exhibits excellent leadership skills as student council president at the Academy and a member of the National Junior Honor Society,” the release continued. “She is a talented and competitive athlete – playing volleyball, basketball, and tennis – yet, she is also active in the Detroit Children’s Choir, the First Presbyterian Church Youth Group, and is a gifted piano player and singer. Isabella is relentless in her desire to succeed and be challenged in all areas of her life, yet she is also generous in offering a helping hand to a peer or classmate. She is the daughter of Timothy and Amy Tomlinson.”

Tomlinson, who will graduate with her eighth-grade Academy classmates on June 14, also earned the prestigious Crane Scholarship from Cranbrook-Kingswood School. In January, her artwork won a “Silver Key” award in the 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards.

<strong>1990 Academy grad and musician tours world, says first gig was at GPA
</strong>

R.J. Ronquillo graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 1990. Since then this guitar phenom has been all over the world supporting musical stars like Stevie Wonder, Ricky Martin and Thompson Square. He’s also much in demand in the studio and just recently collaborated with a major musical instrument manufacturer on his own signature guitar.

But despite earning huge accolades from the music literati and playing guitar with Santana, Tupac Shakur and DMX, Ronquillo said he’ll always carry a special fondness for the time he played at the Halloween dance as a middle schooler at the Academy.

“My very first gig ever was in the 7th grade,” he said. “One of my classmates, Mr. DeLuca [current GPA assistant head of school for instruction and grades 1-8 principal] and I had a band called The Plague with Mike Gandelot and Paul Cure, both from GPA’s Class of '89. We played the Halloween dance in the old auditorium upstairs and I was so nervous that I played the entire first song, ‘Sweet Child of Mine’ by Guns N’ Roses, behind the curtain!”

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150910145926.jpg" alt="" align="right" border="0" />

But despite his first-timer nerves, Ronquillo said without a doubt, all of the teachers at GPA were very encouraging and supportive of his passion for music.

“Mrs. Chrisner, our music teacher, always found ways to utilize every student's talent in all of the various programs and plays.”

Ronquillo remembers playing guitar quite a lot at school functions. Things like talent shows, Christmas luncheons, dances, 8th grade plays, to name only a few.

“Another great memory for me involved one of my English teachers at GPA, who played drums in a local rock band and was actually playing at one of the school dances,” Ronquillo said. “He invited me up to play ‘La Bamba,’ which I had just learned. I think the movie had just come out. Ironically, I recently met David Hidalgo from Los Lobos at a festival we were both playing, and I told him that story.”

<strong>Grosse Pointe to Nashville by way of Miami and L.A.</strong>

Ronquillo grew up in Grosse Pointe. He attended Grosse Pointe South and then earned a bachelor’s degree in studio music and jazz performance from the University of Miami after his graduation from GPA, where he started as a preschooler.

He said that even though he originally learned to play piano as a 6-year-old, he found the guitar more to his liking and as he got older, his guitar playing began to earn him high praise to the point that currently he gets calls not only from the major acts touring the world, but even from some of the companies that actually make guitars and other musical instruments.

<img src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20150910150404.jpg" alt="" align="left" border="0" />

In fact, he’s been working since 2011 with Ontario, Canada-based Eastwood Guitars on testing and making demo videos for their instruments, which have been played by the likes of Calexico, John Fogerty and the Foo Fighters. Recently the company released a new “R.J. Ronquillo” signature model guitar.

“One of my favorite Eastwood models is the Airline Tuxedo because of its open ‘woody’ sound, which makes it great for my particular style of blues and jazz,” he said. “When Eastwood came to me about doing a signature model, I knew immediately that I wanted it to be based on that original Tuxedo. But what makes my signature model unique is that it’s a double-cutaway body, has 22 frets and a special custom tone switch.”

<strong>One man band</strong>

Going back a few more years, Ronquillo said he also spent time in Los Angeles, where he not only did session work, he played a number of dates alone as a one-man band. A news report about him during that time said Ronquillo, “unlike many other modern one-man bands, doesn’t rely at all on the novelty of the concept, foregoing all the bells and whistles and noise-making contraptions, and going strictly on his strength as a talented musician and singer/songwriter. It’s quality, not quantity, and his studio full-length album, ‘One Man Blues Band,’ is proof enough of that, with such standout originals as ‘Simmer Down,’ ‘Wanderin' Eye,’ and ‘<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3rtiZDJcE0" target="_blank">If You Love Me</a></strong>.’”

But it’s his collaborative work on stage that makes Ronquillo stand out even more.

A few years, Ronquillo was hired by Ricky Martin for a tour that lasted eight months and covered the U.S., Mexico, Central America, South America, Spain and Italy.

“We played arenas and stadiums that included Madison Square Garden, Staples Center and River Plate in Buenos Aires. It was an amazing experience.”

He recalled another memorable gig that saw him back up both Stevie Wonder and Brian McKnight at the same time.

“We were on a TV show and played two songs, ‘Do I Do’ and ‘My Cherie Amour.’ As a fan of both singers, it was such a treat to hear them together.”

Now based in Nashville, Tenn., Ronquillo has been extremely busy of late. He’s currently on a lengthy U.S. tour with country duo <strong><a href="http://www.thompsonsquare.com" target="_blank">Thompson Square</a></strong>, who just got nominated as CMA Vocal Duo of The Year for the fourth year in a row.

“I’m also continuing to film gear-demo videos for various guitar, amp and effects companies,” he said. “And I recently released a record—yes, a vinyl record(!)—with my band ‘RJ &amp; The Del Guapos.’ The record was featured recently in <strong><a href="http://www.thomassiano.com/files/Vintage%20Guitar%20Hit%20List%20Review.pdf" target="_blank">Vintage Guitar Magazine</a></strong>.”

Surely a busy and obviously successful guy, and one who appears to have a very promising future ahead of him. But even though he’s already rubbed elbows with many of the world’s most famous entertainers and musical stars, Ronquillo still cannot forget his formative years at The Grosse Pointe Academy.

“I have so many good memories from GPA. I loved running around on all of the numerous playgrounds, and ice skating in the winter when the soccer field was converted into an ice rink. And of course, the summer camping trips with Mr. Fultz!”

<strong>Academy alum is touring and making records, says her time at GPA prepared her well for high school, college — and life. </strong>

<center></center>By any measurement, Grosse Pointe Academy alum Victoria Reed’s musical career has hit full stride. She’s in the middle of an extensive tour that has taken her from Barcelona, Spain, to Brooklyn, New York, which, by the way, is her current hometown. She’s got a show tonight in Boston and on Apr. 27, her tour brings her to the Majestic Cafe in Detroit.

And Reed’s critically acclaimed debut album, “Chariot,” came out Feb. 26.

But it’s not like all of this came about by happenstance.

As she was growing up in Grosse Pointe and attending The Grosse Pointe Academy for grade school, performing was never far from Reed’s mind. After all, her father is Alto Reed, the longtime saxophonist for Detroit legend Bob Seger, and she spent her childhood backstage at Detroit’s biggest venues and sometimes in the front row at Tigers and Red Wings games as her dad wailed out the Star-Spangled Banner on his sax.

“I don’t think there was one moment of my life when I wasn’t thinking, ‘of course I’m going to be a singer someday,’” Reed said.

She also said her music memories go back as far as GPA’s lower school.

“I can remember wishing and praying every night to get the one solo in our first-grade play, ‘The Littlest Bell,’” she recalled. “And I ultimately got the part! That was a very memorable moment for me!”

Reed, 26, even started writing songs while in grade school, drawing inspiration from her parents’ Carole King and Gordon Lightfoot records, and when she was 14, she jetted off to Miami to record a few demos with a successful producer. “I was going to be a young teen pop star,” she said, but now she’s grateful that didn’t happen.

“I was recording my songs over the tracks that Lindsey Lohan or Mandy Moore had passed on. It just wasn’t right.”

Songwriting then took a backseat when Reed moved to Chicago for college and began studying philosophy at DePaul University. While in Chicago, Reed worked a number of jobs, did an independent study in metaphysics, and assisted her then-boyfriend’s psychic mother “teach classes on developing your intuition.”

But she said she missed making music and, after a failed attempt at mastering the music-making computer software, Ableton Live, she finally picked up the guitar her dad had given her years ago and taught herself a few chords. Within a month she was out playing open-mic nights and recording bedroom demos, which she posted online.

</div>
The next thing she knew, Reed—who had never before played with a band—was in a studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, recording “Chariot” with a group of high-caliber session musicians who had put in time with Norah Jones and Ryan Adams. “It was magical,” she said. “We didn’t talk about what kind of sound we were going for—it just happened.”

A few months later Reed packed up her Wicker Park apartment in Chicago and moved to New York for good. She recorded “Chariot” slowly over the course of two years, but for her the pace was ideal.

“This was all so new to me in the beginning, and as we went along I learned to express what I wanted in a room full of people who had been doing this for years.”

Fast-forward to 2016, she's now on tour and being favorably compared in some circles to ’90s singers Jewel and Alanis Morissette. And Reed’s new album continues to earn critical praise with reviews calling it “melodically gorgeous, with dreamy folk vocals.”

She gives props to the many along the way to her current spot in the musical world, including and especially her father, Alto Reed.

But she also reserves a special dose of gratitude for the time she spent at The Grosse Pointe Academy and how it prepared her for the next levels of schooling and life.

“I always felt very well-prepared and rarely was I in over my head in high school,” she said. “I definitely think that trickled on down the line to college as well.”

She said GPA had the most wonderful teachers.

“I honestly loved them all! The music instructor, Mrs. [Marion] Chrisner, my pre-school teacher, Mrs. Beth [Plotzke], my second grade teacher, Mrs. [Renee] Martin, my fourth and fifth grade teacher, Mrs. [Barbara] Markus, just to name a few,” she said. “Everyone was always so nurturing and kind. I also made so many wonderful lifelong friends at that school. To this day, I live just a few blocks away in New York City from some of my best friends that I met in preschool at GPA. And we're as close now as we were then. That's pretty cool, right?”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Board of Trustees of The Grosse Pointe Academy announced this week that Thomas “Tommy” Adams will be its new Head of School, effective July 1, 2016. Adams will take over for Lars Kuelling, who has served as school head for four years and currently is exploring independent school opportunities in a K-12 environment.

Adams currently is assistant head of school for enrollment at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pa., where he has served for eight years. He holds a bachelor’s degree in theater from Roanoke College and an M.S. in education with a focus on education leadership from the University of Pennsylvania.

Adams began his career with independent schools at The Northwood School in Lake Placid, N.Y., where he was a social studies faculty member, teaching eleventh-grade geography. He also spent time at The Gunnery in Washington, Conn., in the admissions department as well as at The Essex Institute, in Essex, N.Y., where he oversaw all curriculum and program development.

“I am deeply honored and thrilled to accept the appointment as The Grosse Pointe Academy’s next head of school,” said Adams. “I am grateful to the search committee for their dedication to the search process and for entrusting me to lead a school community that is clearly passionate about educating and nurturing the potential of young people. I am truly inspired by the clear enthusiasm and affection that the community has for this school and its programs.”

John Murphy, who is board chair at the Academy, said parents, students and faculty members are looking forward to Adams joining the staff.

“Tommy will be a real asset to GPA,” Murphy said. “He brings a wealth of experience and talent in independent-school administration to the Academy. But, even more important, he will be bringing a very obvious and infectious enthusiasm to our campus that will be critically important as we are setting rather ambitious goals for the Academy.”

In addition to his direct school leadership roles, Adams, who is married with three children, founded and currently is the acting director of The Erdmann Institute for Enrollment Leadership in South Casco, Maine, which supports and enhances the skills of mid-career and senior-level independent school admissions professionals.

“Through the years, The Grosse Pointe Academy has thrived due to the devotion of all those who have helped make this a vibrant and healthy community,” board chair Murphy added. “And it’s a community ready to join together with Tommy to enthusiastically engage an exciting future.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Reservations are due by April 22, according to auction officials</strong>

It’s been a flurry of activity at auction central at The Grosse Pointe Academy as volunteers, auction chairs and school officials are preparing for the 49th GPA Action Auction, which is scheduled for May 7, 2016, 6 p.m., on the Academy’s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.

In December, Bill and Kelley Smith, and Robin and Kim Kendrick were named co-chairs for the auction and Connie and Brian Demkowicz were named honorary chairs. Huntington Bank of Michigan is the presenting corporate sponsor.

“Although the auction is in May, much of the real action has been happening for some time now,” said Kristen Van Pelt, GPA’s director of development. “Led by our co-chairs, honorary chairs and the many volunteers, plans have been ongoing almost since last year’s auction finished. Our team is putting the final touches on the hundreds of donations, advertisements and corporate sponsorships as well as planning the decorations and other arrangements that will make the auction the Pointes’ biggest event of the spring.”

The auction theme this year is “Fête des Amis – Together We Flourish,” and Van Pelt said the school is bringing together 49 years of community leadership for one spectacular evening.

[caption id="attachment_25558" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/auction-2015_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25558"><img class="wp-image-25558 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/auction-2015_1000px.jpg" alt="auction-2015_1000px" width="1000" height="799" /></a> Last year’s auction netted more than $450,000 for the Academy’s academic offerings, scholarship and tuition assistance funds, and support for the preservation of its historic campus.[/caption]

“The event is a great tribute to the dedication and hard work of so many within our Academy family,” Van Pelt said. “So we hope you marked your calendars for Saturday, May 7,  and we look forward to seeing you on such a wonderful evening for our great school.”

Van Pelt said reservations to attend the auction must be received by April 22. To purchase tickets, go online to <strong><a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com" target="_blank">gpa.preclickbid.com</a></strong>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>In the photo above, from left, are GPA language arts teacher Bridgett Murray and GPA eighth-graders Shekinah Aho, Tierney Janovsky and Nafi Sall. Farm Bureau Insurance agent Colleen Dyer, who sponsored the Academy’s participation in the essay contest, is at right.</em></strong>

Three students from The Grosse Pointe Academy in Grosse Pointe Farms have been named local winners in the 47th annual America &amp; Me Essay Contest, sponsored by Farm Bureau Insurance.

The three students, who earned the first-, second-, and third-place awards for the Academy, are Shekinah Aho, first, Tierney Janovsky, second, and Nafissatou Sall, third. All three received award certificates for their achievement. As the school's first-place winner, Aho’s name will also be engraved on a plaque for permanent display in the school.

The Grosse Pointe Academy’s participation in the America &amp; Me Essay Contest was sponsored by Farm Bureau Insurance agent Colleen Dyer of Grosse Pointe Woods.

Aho's first-place essay now advances to the state-level competition, from which the top ten essays in Michigan will be selected. The top ten statewide winners, who will be announced later this month, will each receive a plaque, a medallion and a cash award of $1,000. In addition, the top ten essayists will be honored at a banquet in Lansing, meet with Michigan's top governmental leaders, and be the featured guests at a Lansing Lugnuts minor league baseball game dedicated in their honor.

A team of finalist judges that includes a top Michigan government official and the sponsoring teachers of last year's top two statewide winners, will determine the ranking of the top ten statewide winners this year.

Several thousand eighth-grade students from over 400 Michigan schools participated in this latest America &amp; Me Essay Contest, which was conducted with the help of Farm Bureau Insurance agents across the state. The topic of the 2015-2016 contest was "My Personal Michigan Hero."

Now in its 47th year, the annual contest encourages Michigan eighth-grade students to write about their American heroes, especially the people who have made a big difference in the students’ personal lives. Hundreds of thousands of Michigan students have participated in the contest since its inception in 1968. As a sponsor of the contest, Farm Bureau Insurance has earned 11 national awards from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Photo above: Grosse Pointe Academy student Max Klaasen is seen during an Optimst dinghy boating event last season.</em>

Academy 6th graders Dougie Cowan and Max Klaasen are heading to San Francisco this weekend to race in one of the biggest youth regattas in the country. The US Optimist Dinghy Association (USODA) Team Trials, held April 19-22, are for sailors age 9-15 from all over the U.S. who have pre-qualified to race at the event, which is hosted by the San Francisco Yacht Club (SFYC).

According to Tiffany Klaasen, Max’s mother, her son is on a team that has 40 young “skippers” competing in the regatta from over 10 different states. “Just in the past calendar year, Max has traveled to Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland, Florida, and Texas to complete in various regattas, helping him to qualify for next week,” she said.

The snub-nosed boats in the Optimist class are single-sailed monohulls and typically are made from fiberglass with a length of around seven feet and a beam of nearly four feet. More than 150,000 sailors from 110 countries compete in the class, which is not only the biggest dinghy class in the world, it is the fastest growing, according to the USODA. More than 85% of Olympic medal winners over the years are former Optimist sailors, USODA also noted.

All USODA events must conform to stringent safety rules and precautions, and utilize numerous monitors, or “safety officers,” in various zones on the water to constantly patrol and observe those participating in the races.

Cowan, who is the son of GPA teacher Michael Cowan, earned his spot in next week’s regatta by virtue of a second-place finish last season in the Optimist Great Lakes Championship, which was held on Lake Erie in Sandusky, Ohio.

According to the San Francisco race sponsors, the Team Trials Regatta next week is important because it will determine who makes it on the U.S. National Optimist team. The top 20 finishers will qualify for the national team and the next 40 make the development team. Both teams will then have access to special training sessions held around the country during race season.

In addition, the USODA will put together a number of teams that will compete in the IODA World, European and North American Championships, as well as the British Nationals and Flanders Youth Regatta. The first IODA world championships were held in Great Britain in 1962.

On next week’s race in California, Tiffany Klaasen said the time the kids spend in San Francisco will be a learning experience. “I am a big advocate of immersion learning, and San Francisco is a city with a rich and diverse history and culture,” she said. “I have been in touch with all of Max’s teachers and have created an itinerary while we are there to do something that will hit on every subject that he is taking at school. Also, along with Dougie’s mom, Amy, we plan to keep the Academy updated on how the boys are doing throughout the race.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>As we remember Maria Montessori on the 64th anniversary of her passing in the Netherlands, The Grosse Pointe Academy, home to Michigan's longest continuous-running <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">Montessori program</a>, is pleased to offer a number of quotes from this most innovative educator.</strong>

“An education capable of saving humanity is no small undertaking; it involves the spiritual development of man, the enhancement of his value as an individual, and the preparation of young people to understand the times in which they live.” <strong>(From Education and Peace by Maria Montessori, originally published in 1949)</strong>

“Directing our action toward mankind means, first and foremost, doing so with regard to the child. The child, that ‘forgotten citizen’, must be appreciated in accordance with his true value. His rights as a human being who shapes all of mankind must become sacred, and the secret laws of his normal psychic development must light the way for civilization.” <strong>(From Education and Peace)</strong>

“We recognize the immense power, the unconscious forces existing in the child on the threshold of life. For many years we have been proclaiming that it is necessary to educate the child from the moment of birth. We have traced, through study and practical experience, the ideal path leading to the world of children, of these beings whose social status has as yet not been determined, whose rights have not been recognized and who nevertheless represent the men of tomorrow.” <strong>(From The San Remo Lectures, 1949, by Maria Montessori)</strong>

“Education should not limit itself to seeking new methods for a mostly arid transmission of knowledge: its aim must be to give the necessary aid to human development.... If ‘the formation of man’ becomes the basis of education, then the coordination of all schools from infancy to maturity, from nursery to university, arises as a first necessity: for man is a unity, an individuality that passes through interdependent phases of development. Each preceding phase prepares the one that follows, forms its base, nurtures the energies that urge towards the succeeding period of life.” <strong>(From Childhood to Adolescence by Maria Montessori, originally published in 1948)</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, students at The Grosse Pointe Academy celebrated Earth Day and the planet that is honored each 22nd day of April with a number of activities school-wide geared toward raising student awareness and promoting stewardship of the environment.

While every classroom at the Academy has been recycling all year long, today’s Earth Day saw GPA first graders have some rather earnest discussions about how important it is for everyone to continue to recycle. The children were reminded of the fact that GPA’s recycling program and its many other educational environmental initiatives earned the school its seventh consecutive “Michigan Green School” designation earlier this year because of all the hard work by the students and teachers during the year.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ED-1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25688"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25688" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ED-1_1000px.jpg" alt="ED-1_1000px" width="1000" height="1183" /></a>

Additionally, the school’s fifth and seventh graders were able to get outside today to clean up the Garden Classroom and their individual class plots to prepare for spring planting.

Academy third graders spent a bit of their Earth Day checking on the progress of the butterflies they've been raising and discussed their plan to release them into the school garden once they hatch.

Also today, at the school’s Peace Pole installation, Kate Kingsley's Early School kindergarten class planted flowers, all of which were donated by current parent Nancy Cotton.

<strong>About Earth Day</strong>
Founded in 1970 as a day of education about environmental issues, Earth Day is now a globally celebrated holiday that is sometimes extended into Earth Week, a full seven days of events focused on green awareness. The brainchild of Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson (1916-2005) and inspired by the antiwar protests of the late 1960s, Earth Day was originally aimed at creating a mass environmental movement. It began as a “national teach-in on the environment” and was held on April 22 to maximize the number of students that could be reached on university campuses. By raising public awareness of air and water pollution, Nelson hoped to bring environmental causes into the national spotlight. (History.com)

<strong>More about Michigan Green Schools</strong>
Michigan Green Schools is a non-profit 501(c)3 agency dedicated to assisting all Michigan schools – public and private – achieve environmental goals which include protecting the air, land, water and animals of our state along with world outreach through good ecological practices and the teaching of educational stewardship of students pre-kindergarten through senior high school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Six students from The Grosse Pointe Academy joined students from a number of other schools affiliated with AIMS (Association of Independent Michigan Schools) on April 28 at an AIMS Upper Elementary Diversity Symposium, which was held at the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016_diversity2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25717"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25717" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016_diversity2_1000px.jpg" alt="2016_diversity2_1000px" width="1000" height="665" /></a>

Kobe Donaldson, Naya Azoury, Braden Vogel, Evelyn Doan, Kalea Martin and Saniyah Smith represented the Academy at the event. According to Megan Black, GPA’s technology and learning specialist, who organized the school’s participation in the outing, each student submitted answers to a survey as part of the selection process.

“But so many students in grades 4 and 5 wanted to attend,” she said, “that we picked randomly from a hat to select the six who actually participated Thursday. We wished we could have taken all of them.”

Black said that when the students first arrived at the museum, they took part in an ice breaker activity with students from the other schools, including University Liggett, Roeper, Meadows Montessori and Academy of Sacred Heart. She said five groups then were formed with a mixture of students from each school who were led on a tour of the museum by an Arab American docent/educator.

Following the tour, students gathered in the Learning Annex at the museum to make Arabic mosaic tiles.

“Then we cleared the tables and enjoyed a delicious Arabic lunch together,” Black said. “After lunch we were taught the Dabke, an Arab folk circle dance, and everyone joined hands around the room in this very traditional cultural dance. Finally, we gathered back in the auditorium and learned about special Arabic cultural objects and traditions.

“Our kids represented the Academy well,” Black added. “Very proud of them!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kyle Prue is a 19-year-old award-winning author of <em>The Sparks: Book One of the Feud Trilogy</em>. He’s also an actor and standup comedian (trains at Second City in Chicago), but his current schedule of gigs is focused on a national book tour that has this Naples, Florida, native visiting middle and high school students around the country.

Prue will be at The Grosse Pointe Academy this Friday, May 13, to speak with sixth- through eighth-grade students from 1:15 - 3 p.m. in the school’s fieldhouse.

He said his main goal is to get young people to read and write more. In fact, in addition to talking to students around the country about The Sparks, he has founded a nonprofit, Sparking Literacy, which encourages book donations for at-risk and underserved students.

Prue’s own interest in reading really took off when he was in the fifth grade.

“I started at a new elementary school when I moved to Naples as a fifth grader,” he said. “They had a reading contest for whoever read the most books. I ended up reading like 200 books, which was a bit of overkill as the next highest kid read about 75 books, but apparently I’m more competitive than I realized. I just really wanted to beat this other student in my class who told me she was a better reader.”

As far as serious writing, Prue said that also began much earlier than most.

“I was lucky because I learned to use writing as an escape at an early age,” he said. “I was in a multi-age program from first through third grade where I had the same teacher for three years. She had an experimental writing program where she gave us an hour a day to write in our journals. She told us to just write freely and not worry about punctuation or grammar, just let the creativity flow. So by the end of that program, I had a stack of notebooks filled with an adventure series. I also did a series called Three Rings that I wrote from the age of 12 to 14 when middle school was really rough. It was a 200-page manuscript. It wasn’t good, but it was good practice.”

<strong>Addressing literacy</strong>

Literacy is a huge issue in the U.S., Prue said, and there really aren’t the resources everywhere to provide for children, especially those at-risk. His goal is to get a group of young adult authors, including himself, together to do more school visits to get more kids in front of a book or to perhaps even write their own.

Prue’s debut book, which he began writing when he was 16, has racked up a number of state and national awards, including for Best Book for Young Adults in Florida and the national award for Best Fiction for Young Adults from the Florida Author’s and Publishers Association. The Sparks also was the runner-up for Best Young Adult Fiction at the Florida Book Festival and won Honorable Mentions at the New England Book Festival, Midwest Book Festival, Southern California Book Festival, and the International London Book Festival. Prue also won a prestigious International Moonbeam award for Best Young Author.

Scott Bowles, from USA Today, writes about <em>The Sparks</em>: “A crackling read. The Sparks builds a vivid world that is at once other-worldly and relatable. Characters spring from the page in a deft twist on mythology that belies Kyle Prue's young age. He's a voice to be heard."

According to the author, <em>The Sparks</em> is the first book in a trilogy, and was conceived late one night when he was suffering a bit from insomnia. At just 16 years old, Prue spent a summer vacation from school writing this first installment of the trilogy. He said he’s currently working on the next two books in the series, tentatively titled <em>The Flames</em> and <em>The Ashes</em>.

A recent high school graduate from Seacrest Country Day School in Naples, Prue’s next stop in his educational career will be at the University of Michigan as a member of the Class of 2020 after taking the next year to finish the two-book sequel in the series and to visit more schools as part of his national tour.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Wellesley grad discusses GPA’s ‘wealth of academic and social learning experiences’ that led to her academic success and a devotion to community service.</strong>

Academy alum Chanel Geter finished her Master of Arts degree in Management from Wake Forest University’s Graduate School of Business last May. She said her elective focus at Wake was on human resources, but throughout the course of the program, she also studied marketing, finance, communication, and more. She now plans to pursue a career in human-resources management, professional-development consulting, and public speaking.

Anybody who knows Geter likely has no doubt that she will be successful in whatever career she pursues. She’s actually currently gainfully employed in Texas, but it was her work with an Austin-based volunteer organization that proved especially noteworthy to the Girls Empowerment Network (GEN), which highlighted Geter in a recent “Volunteer in the Community” profile during National Volunteer Month. According to GEN’s mission statement, its role in the world “is to support and guide girls to make wise choices as they navigate the unique pressures of girlhood.”

“I love having the feeling that accompanies knowing that our community of volunteers is helping girls throughout the great state of Texas to challenge some of the messages that they receive on a daily basis, while exploring their girlhood, and helping them flourish through self-love,” Geter said in the profile.

Geter graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 2006, after which she matriculated to West Bloomfield High School where she finished with honors and a 4.18 grade point average that helped get her into prestigious Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She graduated from Wellesley in 2014 with double majors in American Studies and Sociology and joined other notable alumnae from the no. 1-ranked U.S. women’s college (2016 U.S. News &amp; World Report), including Hillary Clinton, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, filmmaker Nora Ephron and journalists Cokie Roberts and Diane Sawyer.

Among many extracurricular activities at Wellesley, Geter said she spent her summers as an undergraduate interning with the Emma L. Bowen Foundation for Minority Interest in Business and Media.

After such an illustrious university career, however, Geter, who now lives in Texas full time, remains especially grateful for the time she spent at the Academy. “I was blessed to attend GPA thanks to significant scholarship assistance,” she said. “Someone's generosity has made all of the difference in my life.”

She said that without a doubt The Grosse Pointe Academy was instrumental in sending her out into the world not only with a solid academic foundation, but with a sincere care and empathy for those less fortunate in the community and in the country.

In a recent interview with the Academy, Geter commented on her GPA experience, her current state of affairs and on what appears to be a very bright future.

<strong>Chanel Geter on specific GPA memories and teachers:</strong>

I remember having really valuable learning moments in social studies class from Mrs. Johnson, sensing that our textbooks were not telling the whole stories of marginalized people. Thus, my first vestiges of student activism started in that classroom as I learned to ask questions and spark discussions. I also remember the bonding that happened in our class as a result of having such a small population of girls (eight out of 25 classmates), so I can still see in my mind's eye Sasha (Ovshinsky) Murphy mentoring us through conflict management. I remember Mr. Zink, our art teacher, who somehow taught us about life while also teaching us to paint. I can picture our Christian Life classroom and Mrs. Krease, who made us blow our noses out in the hallway. And then there was Mr. Fultz, who told me that he would flunk me if I didn't dissect my frog in his biology class. I will also never forget Mrs. Chrisner working with me on my solo for the 8th-grade play and then me missing the note by a mile on stage. An image of Mrs. Roberts at the front of the classroom lecturing us on the power of perception still sticks in my mind. It was also Mr. Cowan who first introduced me to Saturday Night Live, of which I am obviously now a huge fan. There are honestly so many moments of very high and very challenging points that I can remember from that time.

<strong>On middle school specifically at the Academy:</strong>

Middle school is a pivotal learning time for everyone, but I know that for me, a young black girl coming from an urban environment and a dynamic family background, it has taken me years to truly appreciate the wealth of academic and social learning experiences that I enjoyed at <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/middle-school-preparation-for-life/" target="_blank">GPA’s middle school</a>. I am forever grateful.

<strong>On how GPA helped with her next levels of education, i.e., high school and college:</strong>

There is no doubt that The Grosse Pointe Academy provided me the academic foundation that later became a major part of my commitment to academic prowess, scholastic excellence, and care for the community. For a quick example, I remember knowing how to write a five-paragraph essay with ease in 9th grade and that other students were starting at a loss. But to be fair, GPA's impact is vastly more than that. At GPA, I was exposed to the lifestyles of business owners and other pillars of the community. It was there that I was first challenged to become the global citizen that Wellesley College would later mold me to be. GPA was the birthplace of my commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equality as a life's mission and daily practice. It was at GPA where I first learned the science behind the birds and the bees, sang and danced on my first stage, and dragged my mother to the mall to purchase my first pair of Birkenstock slip-ins (which I still have!). All I can say is thank you to all of the teachers, staff, stakeholders, parents, classmates, and mentors who I was too young to truly appreciate at that time.

<strong>On her involvement with the Girls Empowerment Network (GEN) and why she got involved in the first place?</strong>

I think it’s best to take a step back from GEN and talk about my community-service commitment in general, if I may. In college, following the model of so many distinguished women leaders of color in my family and community, I joined the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Being a Wellesley woman and a Delta at the same time, I had amazing opportunities to support my community through volunteering. In the last five years, I have worked with a number of great organizations, helping with projects spanning from teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) to tutoring and mentoring younger students, and providing resources to support girls in my community. Most recently since moving to Austin to work in HR management, I have been involved with the Girls Empowerment Network (GEN), which supports and guides girls to make wise decisions, and as a volunteer at various workshops and conferences. I have also started to work with the Girl Scouts of Central Texas by way of my budding business, M4H, which provides professional development consulting for people, businesses and communities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy faculty member began ‘teaching’ in the corporate world. </strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CHU01edit-crop_815px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25823"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25823" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CHU01edit-crop_815px.jpg" alt="CHU01edit-crop_815px" width="815" height="950" /></a>

Even as a high school student, Academy music teacher Roshell Chuhran’s flair for teaching was already beginning to form. A talented musician as well as a talented student, Chuhran began giving piano lessons as a 10th grader to young children in her hometown of St. Clair Shores.

By the time she got her first college degree, however, Chuhran’s career sights were focused in a completely different direction. Or so she thought.

“I had a degree in business and enjoyed working with people, so I began my working career path as a service representative for a phone company,” she said. “It seemed like a great fit for a while, and during my 10 years with the company, I also began overseeing the training of employees on changes in policy, product, procedure and computer systems.”

Chuhran also began developing more efficient training materials for new company hires and after spending so much time training people, she realized that what she was actually doing was not really training people; she was “teaching” people.

[caption id="attachment_25787" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chuhran_opening-ceremony-2015_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25787"><img class="wp-image-25787 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chuhran_opening-ceremony-2015_1200px.jpg" alt="Chuhran_opening-ceremony-2015_1200px" width="1200" height="706" /></a> Music teacher Roshell Chuhran, right, plays during the Academy's opening ceremony last fall.[/caption]

So after accepting a buyout from the phone company, she went back to school and completed a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. Now she was able to combine this born-again desire to teach with a real passion for music in an actual career.

“I began teaching formally 16 years ago at St. Clair Shores Montessori School,” Chuhran said. “When that school closed, I transferred to Warren-Sterling Montessori School and during the summer months, I also worked with the children to produce a musical for friends and family. That was really fun!”

It was not until October of 2003 that Chuhran accepted a position at The Grosse Pointe Academy where she now teaches music to students in the Early School through sixth grade. She shares duties with Bob Foster, who handles music education for GPA’s seventh and eighth graders.

“When I first came on board at the Academy,” Chuhran said, “I remember being very impressed with how warm and inviting the staff was as well as the overwhelming family atmosphere throughout the school.”

Since 2003, Chuhran said, she’s also been witness to much change at GPA, including some faculty and staff changes.

“There has been a fairly large turnover in personnel since I started here,” she said. “But while I’ve seen many talented teachers put down their chalk and retire, I’ve seen just as many talented new teachers come in and pick up iPads while continuing with the school’s great traditions and vibrant learning environment.”

As for what gets Chuhran up every week-day morning and head to the Academy, she has one word for it: passion.

“I really do have a passion for inspiring others, a passion for challenging others and a passion for nurturing others,” she said. “I try to put my students in acting roles that oftentimes take them out of their comfort zones or to challenge them to think of things through a character’s eyes. Plus, I try to inspire in them my own love of music and performance with many different classroom activities. I think the nurturing part comes in with students who may not believe they have any skills or talents when in fact I am always assuring them that they in fact do!”

[caption id="attachment_25785" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chuhran_1st-graders-in-sea_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25785"><img class="wp-image-25785 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Chuhran_1st-graders-in-sea_1200px.jpg" alt="Chuhran_1st-graders in sea_1200px" width="1200" height="641" /></a> Chuhran leads first graders in practice for an upcoming performance of “Aquarium” from Carnival of the Animals, by French composer Camille Saint-Saens.[/caption]

So what does this obviously passionate teacher do when she’s not musically nurturing, challenging and inspiring at GPA?

Well, for one thing she’s nurturing still other musicians, young and old, as the director of music at a local church, a position she’s held for 25 years now and counting. For another thing, she’s just wrapped up a master’s degree in education. And for still another thing, she says she tries to get out on the lake whenever possible.

“When I was growing up, my family had a house on the water and I spent a major part of my youth having fun on Lake St. Clair,” she said. “If it's a water sport, I'm in!”

Chuhran likewise tries to spend as much time with her still-growing family.

“I have three daughters, two of whom are GPA alumni,” she said. “I also now have a grandson and you know what — every good thing they say about being a grandparent is absolutely true!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two silver medals and one bronze medal highlight a strong showing by Grosse Pointe Academy students in the most recent edition of the National Spanish Examinations.

Shekinah Aho (8), Emma Smith (8) both earned silver medals and Joshua Roberts (8) won a bronze medal in the annual competition sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. In addition, “honor” awards were conferred to six students from GPA. All student participants were honored today at this morning’s chapel.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spanish_Flag_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25796"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-25796" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spanish_Flag_1200px-300x200.jpg" alt="spanish_Flag_1200px" width="300" height="200" /></a>“Attaining a medal or honorable mention for any student on the National Spanish Examinations is very prestigious,” said Kevin Cessna-Buscemi, National Director of the Exams. “The exams are the largest of their kind in the United States with tens of thousands of students participating each year.”

According to Veronica Alatorre, who teaches fifth through eighth grade Spanish, this year’s competition pitted the Academy students against mostly high school students.

“This was a great effort by all my students,” Alatorre said. “Some didn't get a medal or honorable mention, but they all deserve recognition for their very hard work and efforts.”

Academy students who scored above the national average and earned honor roll acclaim are Alexandria Belyue (7), Alessandro Cavataio (7), Lachlan Doan (7), Kaitlyn Gray (7), Angel Jones (7) and Noah Humphries (8).

They are the most widely used tests of Spanish in the United States. This year, more than 160,000 students participated in the online version of the exam. The National Spanish Examinations are recognized by many administrative and teaching associations and organizations at the local, state and national levels.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy student soon heading to Maryland for national spelling bee after filming promotional video commercials in California.</strong>

Grosse Pointe Academy eighth-grader Maria Fields will be in Maryland later this month to participate in the 89th annual Scripps National Spelling Bee. She earned her place in the national competition after winning the local WXYZ-Scripps Spelling Bee, which was held in early March.

Fields’ winning word in the local spelling bee was “stratocracy,” and the word that propelled her into the final round was “endotracheal.”

In late April, Fields was one of a few national qualifiers chosen to travel to Hollywood, Calif., to film a series of promotional TV commercials for the the national bee, which will be held May 24-26, 2016, in Oxon Hill, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. One of the finished commercials is available below. Two others are available here by clicking on these URLs:

<strong>About the Scripps National Spelling Bee</strong>
As the nation’s largest and longest-running educational program, the Scripps National Spelling Bee has proven itself as more than a competition for children; it has become a classic element of Americana. Last year’s primetime competition on ESPN led to the Bee being the most tweeted show of the week. ESPN will broadcast live from the Championship Finals on Thursday, May 26, from 8-10 p.m. EDT.

In a short video produced a few years ago by the Boyd School, a Montessori school in Virginia, and available on this page, we can see what a number of the world’s exceptional doers, thinkers and performers have in common: Montessori.

It is proof once again of the central tenet of the Montessori philosophy that says education — especially for the very young — cultivates a child's intrinsic desire to learn. And do. And explore. And ultimately, to be successful contributors to their world.

And like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Joshua Bell, Jeff Bezos and Yo Yo Ma, who were once very young Montessori students themselves, children in The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Montessori Early School are given the same freedoms they had. Freedom to explore the excitement of learning at their own pace — with carefully chosen materials designed to foster each child’s individual talents — all under the careful guidance of the Academy’s Montessori instructors.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GPA-girls_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25838"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25838" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GPA-girls_1000px.jpg" alt="GPA girls_1000px" width="1000" height="800" /></a>

According to Jennifer Kendall, the Academy’s assistant head of school for early school education and admissions, children in GPA’s Montessori classrooms are are taught to make individual choices based on their abilities and interests, to take Montessori materials from the child height shelves, and to develop budding interests.

“Our teachers foster this process by assessing the children’s readiness for a learning activity, demonstrating a skill, and guiding a child’s work as necessary,” Kendall said.

The video is available below. . .

Other GPA student participants in the contest are in the back, from left, Alexander Kuplicki, Kalea Martin, Allie Larpenteur, Zoe Bamford, Saniyah Smith and Robbie Peabody.[/caption]

Gia and Angelina Randazzo found out today that they had won two of the top three prizes in the annual Grosse Pointe News “Kids’ Ads” design contest.

Gia Randazzo took first prize in the contest and her sister, Angelina, earned the third-place prize in the contest that includes many Grosse Pointe-area students in creating ads for area companies and advertisers.

A total of eight fifth graders from the Academy participated in the contest, which had more than 500 local students designing ads for more than 50 local businesses.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pages-from-052616-KA_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25853"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25853" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pages-from-052616-KA_1000px.jpg" alt="Pages from 052616-KA_1000px" width="1000" height="1048" /></a>

“For each of our area businesses who participated in this annual contest the students created an ad that was published this week in a special section (URL) of the Grosse Pointe News,” said a statement from the Grosse Pointe News. “All ads were judged for each business and the winning ad for each business is published in the special section along with an acknowledgment of each student’s name and school.”

A rep for the Grosse Pointe News dropped off extra copies of the special “Kids’ Ads” section today to GPA. A formal presentation and acknowledgment of the kids and their design work is planned for early June.

The American Montessori Society (AMS), which is based in based in New York City with nearly 13,000 members worldwide, is the foremost advocate for quality Montessori education, an innovative, child-centered approach to learning.

Among many other resources available to its members, AMS offers below a "quick sketch" of the advantages of a Montessori education. A short video from AMS on "valuing diversity" also is included below.

<strong>NOTE: The Grosse Pointe Academy has the longest continuously operating <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">Monterossi program</a> in the State of Michigan.</strong>

<em>From AMS: Montessori education offers our children opportunities to develop their potential as they step out into the world as engaged, competent, responsible, and respectful citizens with an understanding and appreciation that learning is for life.</em>

• Each child is valued as a unique individual. Montessori education recognizes that children learn in different ways, and accommodates all learning styles. Students are also free to learn at their own pace, each advancing through the curriculum as he is ready, guided by the teacher and an individualized learning plan.

• Beginning at an early age, Montessori students develop order, coordination, concentration, and independence. Classroom design, materials, and daily routines support the individual’s emerging “self-regulation” (ability to educate one’s self, and to think about what one is learning), toddlers through adolescents.

• Students are part of a close, caring community. The multi-age classroom—typically spanning 3 years—re-creates a family structure. Older students enjoy stature as mentors and role models; younger children feel supported and gain confidence about the challenges ahead. Teachers model respect, loving kindness, and a belief in peaceful conflict resolution.

• Montessori students enjoy freedom within limits. Working within parameters set by their teachers, students are active participants in deciding what their focus of learning will be. Montessorians understand that internal satisfaction drives the child’s curiosity and interest and results in joyous learning that is sustainable over a lifetime.

• Students are supported in becoming active seekers of knowledge. Teachers provide environments where students have the freedom and the tools to pursue answers to their own questions.

• Self-correction and self-assessment are an integral part of the Montessori classroom approach. As they mature, students learn to look critically at their work, and become adept at recognizing, correcting, and learning from their errors.

Given the freedom and support to question, to probe deeply, and to make connections, Montessori students become confident, enthusiastic, self-directed learners. They are able to think critically, work collaboratively, and act boldly—a skill set for the 21st century.

<strong>More about AMS:</strong> The American Montessori Society (AMS) is the foremost advocate for quality Montessori education, an innovative, child-centered approach to learning. AMS sets the high professional standards that inform Montessori education as practiced in AMS-accredited schools and taught in AMS-affiliated teacher education programs. A not-for-profit organization based in New York City, with nearly 13,000 members worldwide, AMS is also a hub of all things Montessori: an information center for its members, the media, and the public; a voice in the public policy arena; and a mobilizing force for the global Montessori community, through support services, research, and professional development events.

The 2016 edition of The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Action Auction was an unqualified success, according to organizers of the annual fundraising event. More than $500,000 was raised this year at the Fête des Amis “Together We Flourish” auction, which was held May 7 on GPA’s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.

The auction guests, comprised of Academy families, community leaders and corporate sponsors, enjoyed an evening of robust bidding on a selection of fabulous and unique items and experiences in both silent and live auction formats. Of particular note, the $177,000 brought in through the auction’s special “paddle raise” was the second highest amount raised in the 49-year history of the auction. School officials said the paddle raise dollars this year are exclusively going for the benefit of Academy teachers’ professional development, curriculum materials and learning spaces.

“The massive success of this year’s auction and paddle raise is a huge testament to the GPA community's appreciation of the work that our faculty does every day with our students,” said Kristen Van Pelt, the school’s development director.

Head of School Lars Kuelling said this year’s auction exceeded all expectations.

“I am truly amazed at how everything comes together so beautifully every year,” he said. "And this year’s auction was a testament to not only the many, many volunteers and staffers who worked on this event, but it showed once again how much our school community values the work our teachers do for the students.

“The success of the paddle-raise, in particular, is in so many ways a tribute to our faculty’s deep care for our students and a recognition by our community of all that they do to provide a top-notch experience for each child,” Kuelling added.

Van Pelt wanted to point out how especially grateful the Academy is for the amount of time and energy exhibited by this year’s auction co-chairs.

“A huge thank you goes to our honorary chairs, Connie and Brian Demkowicz, and to our co-chairs, Bill and Kelley Smith, and Robin and Kim Kendrick, who put in a great deal of voluntary time and energy in order to ensure the success of this year’s auction,” she said.

Van Pelt also pointed out that while the Academy has wrapped up the 2016 auction, another one awaits in 2017. In fact, 2017's event will mark the 50th anniversary of Action Auction and work has already begun to help ensure next year’s Fête des Amis also proves successful.

“Putting this event together is a year-round effort and a labor of love to support the mission of our school, and we are well on our way in planning for the 2017 auction, which is scheduled for May 13, 2017,” she said. "We are looking forward to celebrating 50 years of successful auctions at The Grosse Pointe Academy next spring.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Personal attention, focus on values and a top-notch early school program drove family with four children to the Academy</strong>

(Updated July 29, 2016)

When Grosse Pointe Academy parent Sandra Cavataio talks about GPA to prospective parents looking for a quality education for their young children, she never hesitates to say that the personal attention that each student gets is without equal. She also says the special attention they get usually results in graduates who are extremely ready for high school, college and beyond.

Cavataio should know. She and her husband, Pietro, have had three of their children graduate from the Academy and a fourth, current 7th-grader Alessandro, graduating next spring.

“I usually tell people that the regular classes at GPA are just like honors classes at the public school,” she said. “I also talk to them about being so impressed with the <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/christian-life/" target="_blank">Christian values</a></strong> instilled in the children and that the students are very confident and present themselves very well because of all of the many opportunities to shine.

“In addition, languages are very strong at GPA and many of the students there end up in level-3 languages during their high school freshman year.”

When Cavataio and her husband first moved to southeast Michigan years ago, education for their children was of primary importance. After all, she holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in industrial engineering from Louisiana Tech University, and husband, Pietro, is a family-practice physician with an office in Chesterfield, Mich.

Cavataio said she originally heard about The Grosse Pointe Academy from another parent at a Gymboree store in metro Detroit and began to ask more questions about GPA to her realtor, which ultimately led to a house in Grosse Pointe Shores and her children at the Pointes’ premier private school.

“I attended private primary and secondary school and my husband attended public schools,” Cavataio said. “But even though the Grosse Pointe public schools had a pretty good reputation, I told him I felt very strongly about private schools and he has come to see the big advantage.”

She also said they kept hearing that GPA had the best <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">early school program</a></strong> around, which was a definite factor since her family was still quite young when they first moved into the area.

Fast forward to 2016, Joseph Cavataio, the oldest of the Cavataio children, is finishing up his first year at the University of Michigan after graduating from Cranbrook-Kingswood a year ago.

Joseph is studying physics and engineering at Michigan. He said he’s interested in both medicine and engineering and thought those study tracks would be a great way to combine both fields of interest.

“Students who major in engineering and physics typically score the highest on the MCATs (Medical College Admission Test), so it's a great vehicle to medical school if I chose to go that route.”

Looking back at his time at the Academy, Joseph wanted to make sure we noted how well-prepared he was for his high school classes.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cavataios2-BW_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25649"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25649" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cavataios2-BW_1000px.jpg" alt="Cavataios2-BW_1000px" width="1000" height="909" /></a>
“My freshman year at Cranbrook was relatively easy for me since I was so far ahead academically,” Joseph said. “I’ve noticed that many other students from The Grosse Pointe Academy also ended up doing well with some going into leadership positions at Cranbrook, ranging from class president to editor of the school newspaper.”

Joseph’s brother, Piero, graduated from GPA last spring and followed his brother’s footsteps to Cranbrook, and his sister, Gabriela, matriculated to University Liggett’s upper school after the Academy.

Summing up The Grosse Pointe Academy experience after many years in the school community, Sandra is quite happy she received such an early tip about the school when she moved to the area.

“The faculty always has been very dedicated and go well out of their way to help the children,” she said. “And because of that, I believe, the kids end up excelling in high school and beyond.”

Two former students of The Grosse Pointe Academy were honored last night by the Alliance Française of Grosse Pointe as the best French students in their grade in high school.

Grace Drettman, who is a senior at University Liggett, and Katie Fruehauf, a junior also at ULS, were nominated by their French teacher, Kristen Karolak, and received Alliance Française accolades on June 6 at the association’s annual award ceremony.

Amal El-Hosni, who teaches French and social studies at the Academy, was the chairperson of the event, which has been held each year for at least thirty years at the Grosse Pointe War Memorial. The ceremony honored students from five different high schools in the area.

“Both Katie and Grace were French students at GPA,” El-Hosni said. “I remember when Katie was in 8th grade at GPA, she had a perfect score on the French National Exam and won first prize. They both were wonderful students!”

The essence—and some would say the beauty—of the Montessori approach to education is its emphasis on a child’s need to move, explore and manipulate the world around him or her in order to better understand it. Program founder Maria Montessori said that “a child’s hands and developing brain are intimately connected.”

The dilemma facing many Montessori schools now that technology is overtaking all things education—including at the earliest levels—is how can the fundamentally hands-on Montessori way of teaching coexist with technology that is available at the touch of a mouse or the swipe on a glass screen?

And how can education technology, or “EdTech,” a now multi-billion dollar industry centered primarily in Silicon Valley, help younger students who most assuredly need the physical stimulus Montessori recommends?

In an article originally published last year, author Amanda Rosenburg discusses some of the important developments in educational technology, which is connecting today’s youngest students in more productive ways with the decidedly “un-technical” Montessori method of learning.

The Grosse Pointe Academy offers Michigan’s longest continuously operating Montessori on its Grosse Pointe Farms campus. <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">More information here</a></strong>.

<strong>What connected technology and Maria Montessori have in common</strong>

By Amanda Rosenburg

The non-touch model of edtech is changing, thanks in part to the century-old theories of early education pioneer Maria Montessori.

Ask a child to sit on her hands while she solves a problem, and it will feel like an insurmountable task--for both the educator and the child. But let her pick up an object, hold it, inspect it, experiment with it--and it becomes clear that a child’s thinking is grounded in touch and movement.

This is the essence of traditional Montessori education, which emphasizes children’s need to move, explore and manipulate the world around them in order to understand it. Montessori believed that “a child’s hands and developing brain are intimately connected.” Her belief can be easily observed in practice by watching any kindergartener try to solve a math equation by counting on his fingers or building a block tower.

But what happens when technology becomes a central point of instruction? How do the youngest students engage with the educational content found in apps and games while still feeling and touching the world around them? Traditional Montessorians, for example, have warned that the current influx of technology is developmentally inappropriate for young learners.

Today's classroom technology falls short of embracing a young child’s senses and skill set. That's because the types of technology early learning classrooms offer their students lack the opportunity for tactile interactivity. Most common are tablets, computers, projectors, or digital cameras, all of which place a high value on output. Few of these technologies require physical manipulatives--things kids can touch and play with--that also connect to the digital realm.

But this is changing. Companies are re-imagining and redefining “education technology” so that classroom computing becomes a more tactile experience for hands-on activities and learning. This approach, called connected technology, involves pairing a physical object the child can hold, such as blocks, with a digital interface, such as a tablet or robot. Sometimes, those objects are used to gather information, as is the case with Tiggly’s tablet-compatible physical manipulatives, or MaKey MaKey’s invention kits. With products like Sphero’s app-enabled robots, the the physical object is on the receiving end of the data.

Why is connected technology so important for a young learner? The simple answer is that it takes the essential aspects of tactile play and builds a bridge to the digital world. While enhancing cognitive learning in young students, connected technology also puts control back into the child’s hands--quite literally. Finding a balance between the technology and the tactile is important especially for classrooms that use tablets. Connected technology also offers the immediate and personalized feedback that is unique to a digital learning environment.

Multiple studies have shown that integrating connected technology into curriculum leads to higher engagement, greater enjoyment and better collaboration while learning. Going forward, edtech developers need to consider the role of touch when creating technology for early elementary children. And early childhood educators must carefully weigh the pros and cons of each type of technology they add to their classrooms.

When teachers first see connected technology being used in the classroom, they usually don’t need to hear the “why”. The potential impact on students’ learning is obvious. Maria Montessori would be pleased to know her learning theories have not only withstood the test of time, but are being applied in the new wave of connected technology.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Current and alum parent says no greater return than on investment in children’s education.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_25939" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Williams-Pic-Caleb-kelsey_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25939"><img class="wp-image-25939 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Williams-Pic-Caleb-kelsey_1000px.jpg" alt="Williams Pic Caleb &amp; kelsey_1000px" width="1000" height="1047" /></a> Caleb Williams, left, and Kelsey Williams in a family photo from a few years ago. Caleb graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 2013 and Kelsey now is going into 7th grade at the Academy.[/caption]

When current parent Latrelle Williams and her husband, Shawn, would drive down Lake Shore Road almost daily on their way to work or on errands beginning around 2008, they noticed the stately looking school near Moran Road, but aside from marveling at its architecture and the beautiful campus on which it sits, nary another thought about The Grosse Pointe Academy would cross their minds.

That is until their son, Caleb, started to tell his parents on a regular basis, “One day I’m going to that school.”

“Finally, his words gave life to his statement and my husband decided to visit a GPA open house,” said Latrelle Williams. And then, as they say, the rest is history.

Caleb enrolled in the Academy and graduated in 2013, and daughter, Kelsey, is heading into the seventh grade when school starts again in September. And mom says she couldn’t be happier with what GPA has brought to her children.

“GPA is a school where children ‘learn to earn’ not because they feel entitled to win, or get a good grade or to just show up,” Williams said. “This is a school where life skills are complemented, academic rigor propels you, strong character leads you, and dedicated teachers educate you way beyond mediocrity.”

[caption id="attachment_25940" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Williams-Pic-Shawn-Latrelle_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25940"><img class="wp-image-25940 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Williams-Pic-Shawn-Latrelle_1000px.jpg" alt="Williams Pic Shawn &amp; Latrelle_1000px" width="1000" height="670" /></a> Shawn Williams, left, and Latrelle Williams were high school sweethearts. They both recognize the value of a good education, especially the one their children are getting from The Grosse Pointe Academy.[/caption]

She also said the Academy is a place where not only the teachers are caring and compassionate, but it also flows from the head of school and all staff members.

“In addition, the strong parental involvement at the Academy shines brightly throughout the community thus proving that it takes a village to raise a child,” Williams added.

Williams and her husband both graduated from Cass Technical High School in Detroit. “We were high school sweethearts,” she said. Latrelle went on to the University of Michigan and Shawn to Western Michigan University. They both currently are successful business people with Latrelle making her way through a career in finance and Shawn in marketing and healthcare.

So it's clear the Williams both recognize the value of a good education.

“It's a sacrifice and an investment,” she said, “but I don't know of any greater return on investment than having your child in a private-school environment like GPA that is so nurturing, challenging, inspiring and that includes a real sense of safety and security.”

“I just wish there was a GPA high school!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we get closer to Maria Montessori’s birthday, which is August 31, The Grosse Pointe Academy, home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">Montessori program</a></strong>, is pleased to offer four more inspiring quotes from this most innovative educator.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/four-colors_maria_HP.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25747"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25747" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/four-colors_maria_HP.jpg" alt="four-colors_maria_HP" width="1600" height="900" /></a>

"The child’s conquests of independence are the basic steps in what is called his “natural development.” In other words, if we observe natural development with sufficient care, we see that it can be defined as the gaining of successive levels of independence." <strong>(From The Absorbent Mind, originally published in 1949)</strong>

"Knowledge can be best given where there is eagerness to learn, so this is the period when the seed of everything can be sown, the child’s mind being like a fertile field, ready to receive what will germinate into culture. But if neglected during this period, or frustrated in its vital needs, the mind of the child becomes artificially dulled, henceforth, to resist imparted knowledge. Interest will no longer be there if the seed be sown too late, but at six years of age all items of culture are received enthusiastically, and later these seeds will expand and grow." <strong>(From To Educate the Human Potential, originally published in 1947)</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/montessori_GPA_feat2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25967"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25967" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/montessori_GPA_feat2.jpg" alt="montessori_GPA_feat2" width="1200" height="589" /></a>

"Yet a third interesting fact to be observed in the young child is his need to associate himself with others, not merely for the sake of company, but in some sort of organized activity. He likes to mix with others in a group wherein each has a different status. A leader is chosen, and is obeyed, and a strong group is formed. This is a natural tendency, through which mankind becomes organized. " <strong>(From To Educate the Human Potential)</strong>

"Education for the very young is not a direct continuation of that which has gone before, though it is built upon that basis. Psychologically there is a decided change in personality, and we recognize that nature has made this a period for the acquisition of culture, just as the former was for the absorption of the environment." <strong>(From To Educate the Human Potential)</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>New head of school looks to bright, active future at The Grosse Pointe Academy.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_25987" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-05-17-18.51.03_edit_RGB_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25987"><img class="wp-image-25987 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-05-17-18.51.03_edit_RGB_1200px.jpg" alt="2015-05-17 18.51.03_edit_RGB_1200px" width="1200" height="1075" /></a> New GPA head Tommy Adams, second from right, is with his wife, Kendall, and sons Colin, Griffin and Logan in Mercersburg, Pa.[/caption]

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">When Thomas “Tommy” Adams started his tenure as The Grosse Pointe Academy’s new head of school this summer, he said he wasn’t planning to spend too much time sitting back and relaxing. There’s a lot of work to do, he said, and he’s looking forward to rolling up his sleeves on July 1 and getting to it.
</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">A thoughtful, ambitious and personable leader, Adams, who left a position as assistant head of school for enrollment at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pa., said he wants to hit the ground running at GPA.  </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“To be sure, my family and I looked forward to arriving this summer and having the opportunity to meet and get to know all members of the GPA family,” he said. “I also want to quickly build up a level of trust and communication within the community at GPA, both internally and externally, so that we can begin to move this school to the next level in important ways.” </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">“I plan to work very hard and look forward to working with our faculty and staff,” he said. “It’s going to be a busy summer and fall.”</span>

Spending a summer and fall in Grosse Pointe also is something Adams is looking forward to. Other than the airport, he said he had never been to the Detroit or Grosse Pointe area before his first GPA interview in February.

“Although I’ve always heard amazing things about the Pointes, it’s quite different when you’re actually here,” he said. “It’s beautiful, and my family and I are excited to become part of the school and local communities.”

He also said it reminds him a bit of Long Island, New York, where he grew up.

[caption id="attachment_25986" align="alignright" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adams_Tommy_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-25986"><img class="wp-image-25986 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adams_Tommy_250px.jpg" alt="Adams_Tommy_250px" width="250" height="299" /></a> Adams grew up on Long Island, New York.[/caption]

“My father was a head of school in an independent school on Long Island, and I had the opportunity to live in a community somewhat similar to Grosse Pointe,” he said. “Both communities are full of people who take a lot of pride in their towns. For example, at the recent GPA Action Auction, I really sensed that people here — parents and staff — are very proud of their school and community. I also sensed that many people have been in the area for a lifetime and are really tuned into their community and school roots.”

Despite his father’s professional experience and his own background as a boarding school student, Adams never planned on a career in education. Instead, as his college graduation approached, he looked toward what he and many of his classmates at Roanoke College thought was their destiny: a career in business.

“I was teaching tennis during the summers when I was in college, and I hired a young woman to help me with the kids,” he said. “Her father was headmaster at Northwood School, a boarding school in Lake Placid, New York, and he and I had a number of conversations about the fact that I loved working with and coaching kids. He asked if I’d ever thought about becoming a teacher, which I had not, and then asked if I would ever consider applying for a job at his school. I had attended Avon Old Farms School, which is a boarding school in Connecticut, and I loved my experience there. So I thought this might be a great first step. I could do this for a couple of years and then I’d go get, quote-unquote, a real job.”

So, with a bachelor’s degree from Roanoke College in hand, off he went to Northwood School. By Thanksgiving break, he knew working in schools was his calling and went on to spend the next three years teaching social studies, being a dorm parent, and coaching three seasons of athletics.

“I loved it. I loved working with kids, loved the fact that I was having an impact on their lives. I felt that this was what I was meant to do.”

But after those three years at Northwood, he developed a passion for working with families as they considered boarding school. Once he found an opportunity to work in admissions, Adams never looked back. He worked at two small boarding schools before landing at The Gunnery, in Washington, Connecticut and then Mercersburg Academy, the two schools where he would spend the bulk of his career. The family’s ties to these schools run deep: eldest son Logan graduated from The Gunnery last year, and son Colin will begin his senior year at Mercersburg this fall. The family’s youngest son, Griffin, will start at GPA come fall.

“Being a parent of a current student has allowed me unique insight into these schools, and Kendall and I look forward to having the same experience at The Grosse Pointe Academy.”

John Murphy, who is board chair at the Academy and was very involved in the school’s head of school search process, said Adams is the perfect choice for the school at this time. “Tommy will be a real asset to GPA,” he said. “He brings a wealth of admissions experience and talent in independent-school administration to our school. But, even more important, he will be bringing a very obvious and infectious enthusiasm to our campus that will be critically important as we are setting some rather ambitious goals for the Academy.”

Adams’ tireless work in school administration over the past two decades in school makes him a unique and strategic choice to take the helm at GPA.

“People may think, and they’re probably right, that I am the unconventional choice for head of school at the Academy. I have been working externally — outside the classroom — for the last 21 years. But the role of director of admissions is no longer what it used to be thirty years ago. My role has expanded from not only focusing on the external piece of the institution, but understanding the internal piece as well. My career in boarding school has further enabled me to do what I most enjoy: work closely with students as an advisor, dorm parent, and coach.”

He said admissions professionals need to know and completely comprehend — and be able to fully explain — the programs, the teaching, the ‘value’ of all of that is their institution.

“Because when families are weighing their educational choices,” he said, “you need to understand the workings of your institution, including the programmatic piece and the teaching piece. You need to believe deeply in the people and philosophies that make up your school. And you need to contribute to its growth in order to meet the evolving expectations of the market.”

Adams is by nature a leader who challenges those around him to think differently and to work progressively to improve themselves and their institution. His involvement in Mercersburg’s all-encompassing program review crystallized for him and for the school just how different today’s world is from the one he and most educators grew up in.

“The way I look at it,” said Adams, “is that teachers today are less the providers of information, and more the ‘coaches’ of that information. Think about it. Anything that teachers teach to a child today is available on the Internet with one or two clicks. So I see teachers not in front of the kids, but more behind them, coaching and helping them to learn for themselves and from each other. That to me is a very striking difference between classroom teaching today versus thirty years ago.”

Adams also thinks that his admissions experience with primarily high school students has given him a rather unique insight into what a successful incoming freshman looks like, and what kind of elementary and middle-school education is necessary to get into quality high schools.

“I clearly see the difference in the kids coming from an independent school,” he said. “These kids tend to transition much better to a school like Mercersburg because of their experience in schools like The Grosse Pointe Academy.

“Independent schools are the best at bringing out the best in kids,” he said. “And that’s how I see our jobs as educators. Teachers in independent schools, I believe, are quite different in that they really feel they have a definite stake in making the kids successful students, athletes, artists, etc. I don’t think you get that quite to this extent anywhere else.”

So what does Adams see as initiatives or needs for the Academy right out of the gate on July 1?

“For one thing, we need more people coming through these beautiful doors,” he said. “Plus, I want to strengthen relationships with those constituents from the past, i.e., alumni, alumni parents, previous donors, etc.”

“Inquiry is an endless process yet essential if independent schools want to compete in a expanding market of educational options,” Adams continued. “Together, we will work thoughtfully to build a school whose graduates are well-prepared to meet head on the challenges of an ever-changing world. Yet as we move forward, we must always remain true to the institution’s important and meaningful traditions.”

[caption id="attachment_26018" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P6240328_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26018"><img class="wp-image-26018 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P6240328_1000px.jpg" alt="P6240328_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Preparing sand for water-filtration device in Mali.[/caption]

Mali is a landlocked country in West Africa where half of its population lives on less than $1.25 per day. Access to clean water is a major problem, particularly in rural areas where 45 percent of the people lack access to clean water.

In a blog post published yesterday by OHorizons, a non-profit coalition of technical, social and commercial innovators managed by Grosse Pointe Academy alum Natalie Relich (’01), a recent water project in Mali received critical "off-site" help from her organization, which passed the test of making clean water available and affordable for residents thousands of miles away who desperately need it.

<strong>Project Profile: Mali + making the OHorizons wood mold construction manual open-source</strong>
June 30, 2016

Population: 14.5 million
Capital: Bamako
Official language: French
Currency: West African CFA franc; population living on less than $2/day: 90%

[caption id="attachment_26016" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Clean_Water_for_Families_in_Mali_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26016"><img class="wp-image-26016 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Clean_Water_for_Families_in_Mali_1000px.jpg" alt="Clean_Water_for_Families_in_Mali_1000px" width="1000" height="429" /></a> Village children in Mali play in and around an empty well.

In 2014, OHorizons received an urgent email asking for assistance from the Mali Water Project, a nonprofit student organization formed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign that had developed and was implementing a safe drinking-water project with the help of local community members in the remote village of Konilo-Coura in Mali.

The Mali Water Project was started in 2010 when Dr. Osee Sanogo, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a native of Konilo-Coura, decided to create an interdisciplinary student team through the university’s Learning in Community Course. His vision was for this organization to support his home village in the creation of a reliable, economically feasible and sustainable solution to their water shortage and quality problems.

Here’s what Dr. Osee Sanogo had to say about the situation in Konilo-Coura:

“There is no running water. People get water from hand-dug wells that are not protected and are often contaminated from above ground sources as demonstrated by our biological water-quality check during the visit.”

The UI Mali Water Project traveled to Mali twice. The first time was in June 2011 with eight people to do a baseline survey and get a better understanding of the situation. The team returned in June 2014 with five people to actually implement their context-appropriate safe drinking water projects including the implementation of biosand filters.

When the second group arrived in Mali in 2014, they realized the steel mold they had contracted to be made by a local welder for their biosand filter project had been made incorrectly. They started searching for an immediate solution to their dilemma. They found OHorizons online, were intrigued by its wood mold innovation, and contacted the organization about the possibility of using its design for their project.

At this time, OHorizons construction manual wasn’t yet open-source and the organization had only been a part of bioSand filter projects in which it had directly facilitated the training's in-country. Through its pilot projects earlier in 2014 in Bangladesh and Ecuador, OHorizons had seen that the trainees had intuitively understood the construction manual and how to make the mold, OHorizons executive director Relich recalled.

“In those settings, our team actually provided little formal ‘training,’” she said. “We were mainly ensuring that safety precautions were being taken and answering any questions as they came up.”

Relich said they saw the student group in Mali as an excellent test to see how a project would function without OHorizons being there to supervise. After a phone call with the MWP, to get a better understanding of who they’d be working with and the needs of the community they were working with, Relich sent OHorizons construction manual to their team in Mali.

“They immediately downloaded our construction manual and purchased the necessary materials,” Relich said. “Within a matter of days, they had successfully constructed several wood molds and were pouring filters. They did all of this in West Africa with very little instruction from the OHorizons staff and with no electricity!”

This was a very exciting development for OHorizons, according to Relich.

“The entire reason behind inventing the wood mold was to reduce as many barriers as possible (financial, technical, etc.) to getting a drinking water project underway,” she said.

Even though the OHorizons team had seen that our construction manual had the potential to be self-taught, Relich said it was still exceptional to see how smoothly a group of students, who a week before were unaware of the innovation, were able to follow our step-by-step manual and work with illiterate community members to construct the wood molds.

“Seeing that the mold could be made with little to no input from OHorizons was a big deal to us,” Relich said. “We realized that we needed to make the manual open-source so more people, like the group from Illinois, could potentially benefit.”

Horizons then concentrated its next couple of months on making the construction manual shorter, as user-friendly as possible and more visual. Utilizing its in-the-field experience from the in-person trainings, OHorizons was able to cut the manual down from about 180 pages to around 80 pages.

Today, the construction manual and its accompanying appendix are super easy to follow and available to download for free from the OHorizons website. The organization is currently translating its manual and appendix to Spanish, French and Portuguese. These versions of the manual should be available to chose from on OHorizon’s website by late fall 2016.

“Since making our construction manual open-source in April of 2015, more than 280 people and organizations from more than 40 different countries have downloaded our wood mold construction manual from our website,” Relich said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Nineteen-eighty-eight grad is making a career on screen and stage.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26035" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/C_Worth_edit3_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26035"><img class="wp-image-26035 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/C_Worth_edit3_1200px.jpg" alt="C_Worth_edit3_1200px" width="1200" height="792" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy alum Catherine (Worth) Chittick ('88) said both high school and college were made much easier because of GPA.[/caption]

When 1988 Grosse Pointe Academy alum Catherine (Worth) Chittick left the Academy, she had her future career already planned out. She said it was partly because of a class she had taken with GPA teacher Mary Lou Fettermann that she wanted to be a forensics pathologist (“CSI-style”).

“I was involved in forensics at GPA with Miss Fettermann,” Chittick said, “but that started my love for acting and storytelling. Plus, I also really think my experience playing Anna in the opening of Ms. (Marion) Chrisner’s ‘The King and I’ made me want to continue to pursue acting and musicals in high school. But even at five years old, my involvement in performing was well entrenched. I started playing violin back then along with piano and singing, so I guess the arts were always part of my life.”

[caption id="attachment_26041" align="aligncenter" width="1200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/verizon-powerful-answers_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26037"><img class="wp-image-26041 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/verizon-powerful-answers_1200px.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="691" /></a> Chittick recently acted in a Verizon commercial, which can be viewed below.[/caption]

The arts, in fact, and not forensic pathology, are now where Chittick firmly resides. She lives in Los Angeles with her actor husband, David Chittick, and two children and she’s been a professional actor in more than nine TV and film roles, including “The Proposal” and “According to Jim.” Her stage experience is even more extensive with more than 13 roles, including nine lead roles, in LA, Chicago and Detroit. Chittick also does TV commercials with her most recent work for Verizon and Walmart.

<strong>SMOOTH TRANSITION</strong>

A fine and performing arts graduate of Wayne State University, which she attended after four years at Mercy High School (Farmington Hills), Chittick said the transition into both high school and college was made much easier because of GPA.

[caption id="attachment_26036" align="alignright" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/photog_IMG_1198_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26036"><img class="wp-image-26036 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/photog_IMG_1198_250px.jpg" alt="photog_IMG_1198_250px" width="250" height="374" /></a> Chittick also manages a professional photography business in California.[/caption]

“I loved the small class sizes at GPA, and Mercy, which also had small classes, was a great transition,” she said. “I felt completely prepared for high school, especially in science. Mr. (Michael) Fultz and Ms. (Sheila) Connolly made science so much fun. As a matter of fact, I attribute my high grades in college science also to them. GPA created my love of science, and I still remember many of it today. I’m even still great at classifying trees!”

As a high school student, Chittick was a member of the National Honor Society, the Who’s Who of high school students, and traveled with the People to People International student ambassador program. She also received a half-tuition scholarship to Wayne State.

After graduating from college, Chittick moved to Chicago to more fully pursue acting. She performed in quite a lot of theater productions around town, but six months into her stay in Chicago, she got a call to come back to Detroit to audition for The Second City, a comedy theater and training center in the Detroit area.

<strong>OFF TO LA</strong>

“After performing on the main stage for almost two years (writing and performing in five different shows), my husband (David) was accepted to a UCLA graduate program for theater,” Chittick recalled. “We moved to California and I started working in theater in Los Angeles. Then I toured with R&amp;B singer Brian McKnight, played violin in his band, and I started booking roles in commercials and television. As an aside, I just recently filmed a commercial for Walmart that actually is airing this summer.”
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKaprhZo8Cc?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
Meanwhile, Chittick still has many fond memories of her time at the Academy, which began for her as a fifth grader — well, actually, it almost DIDN’T begin as a fifth grader.

“I almost didn’t make it to fifth grade at GPA,” she said. “I had come from a school in my neighborhood and had never taken standardized tests. So when I originally took a test for a different school in Grosse Pointe, they said they would not accept me in fifth grade. Then, when I took the test for GPA, the administration suggested that I repeat fourth grade. But after interviewing me, they decided to let me start in fifth. I was on the high honor role every year that I was at GPA, so I am grateful that the school gave me a chance.”

“I loved Mr. Fultz and all of his trips while at GPA,” she said. “I still talk to my kids about them. And I loved Mr. ‘Ski’ (Gary Skwarczynski) and his English class. I can still remember reading ‘The Lottery’ by Shirley Jackson in his class, which began my love for dystopian literature. French teacher Madame Anne Franco began my love of French and I spent nine years going to French camp because of her. I even went to France with the People to People organization partly because of her, and I still speak “Franglais” at home with my own children.”

In a blog first published on the website <a href="http://buildingthepinktower.org" target="_blank">buildingthepinktower.org</a> titled “Walk into a Montessori Classroom,” the Montessori approach to education is discussed as one that offers children intentionally prepared environments that are "full of beauty and order."

It also talks about Montessori environments as “designed to meet the developmental needs of each child," and “alive with movement and sound.”

Check it out below. . .

In addition, take a look at the following short video, which was created as part of the documentary film project, “Building the Pink Tower.” It gives a glimpse of a typical Montessori school classroom.

More information on The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Montessori program — Michigan’s longest continuously running Montessori program — is <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.

<strong>Walk into a Montessori Classroom</strong>

Montessori environments are beautiful, full of natural light, wooden beads and blocks, books of all kinds, and flowers in glass vases. Montessori classrooms are alive with movement and sound. Students, whether 5 or 15 years old, move about the classroom to take things off shelves, to discuss a project with a classmate, to put things away. Montessori students are busy. Some are working alone, bent over a mat on the floor or sitting at a small table. Some are gathered around a teacher, in conversation during a lesson. Others are working in groups, their voices and bodies and minds engaged in collaborative work.

In a Montessori classroom, order and creativity coexist. Animated conversation and silent observation work together in the same space. In the best environments, children of all races and cultures learn side by side.

Through careful observation of how children work and interact, Maria Montessori developed what we think of as the Montessori Method more than 100 years ago. She began her work in the slums of Rome, and her vision has spread throughout the world.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bd4a4815_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26118"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26118" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bd4a4815_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a4815_1000px" width="1000" height="800" /></a>

The Montessori approach offers children intentionally prepared environments that are full of beauty and order. Materials in the classroom are appealing and designed to meet the developmental needs of each child. Montessori-trained teachers are the bridge between the environment and the student, first through careful observation of each child, and then by providing appropriate instruction and guidance.

What do children in a Montessori classroom gain? They learn reading, math, science, history, and geography – the subjects they need to know. But they get this knowledge through their own desire to learn, by following their passions and making connections between ideas and subject areas. They seldom learn only by listening to a teacher or reading a text book. Instead, they learn by doing things, working collaboratively, making mistakes, and solving problems. Rather than learning only well enough for the next test, this kind of learning sticks, reaching far beyond tests and becoming a part of each child’s identity, helping them to emerge fully in their world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>GPA Spanish teacher says to become true community ‘ambassadors,’ students must learn that culture is as important as learning a second language.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26147" align="alignright" width="257"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Veronica_Alatorre-GPA-_pic_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26147"><img class="wp-image-26147 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Veronica_Alatorre-GPA-_pic_1000px-257x300.jpg" alt="Veronica_Alatorre-GPA _pic_1000px" width="257" height="300" /></a> Spanish teacher Veronica Alatorre has been at The Grosse Pointe Academy since 2011.[/caption]

Winning national awards and finishing strong in language competitions are fairly routine for students of The Grosse Pointe Academy. In fact, a number of students brought home top medals late in the last school year from the National Spanish Examination, one of the most competitive tests of Spanish for students living in the United States.

Much of the school’s success with such competitions can be attributed to GPA’s strong emphasis on world languages for all of its students. And perhaps no one personifies that focus more than Veronica Alatorre, who has been teaching fifth through eighth grade Spanish at the Academy since 2011.

A graduate of Centro Universitario de la Comunicacion in Mexico City who first came to the United States in 2000, Alatorre has quite a comprehensive and unique approach to the Spanish language for her students.

“I try to teach the kids to communicate in Spanish by using their own thoughts, feelings and ideas,” said Alatorre. “I don't want them to memorize and repeat, but to use the tools I give them as a means to express themselves and to be able to use them anytime in the future.”

It’s an approach to teaching foreign language that works best when it’s used by native speakers who also bring an inherent first-hand cultural experience, according to Alatorre.

“Culture is as important as language,” she said. “It helps to minimize mistakes and misunderstandings, it gives a more accurate phonetic pronunciation and promotes tolerance. It also teaches the kids about perspectives of life and that being and thinking different is perfectly okay.”

[caption id="attachment_26154" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2790edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26154"><img class="wp-image-26154 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2790edit_1000px.jpg" alt="IMG_2790edit_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Alatorre loves the outdoors and sports, including kayaking. According to Lawrence DeLuca, who is the principal of grades 1-8 at the Academy, Alatorre is one of the most caring teachers he's ever met. "Her class is always filled with fun ways to teach Spanish, and she does a great job covering high school Spanish I and preparing our students for Spanish II," he said.[/caption]

Different might also be a good word to describe the route Alatorre took to becoming a Spanish teacher at the Academy. Currently a single mother with four children of her own, Alatorre was a creative and ambitious child growing up in Mexico. She came from a fairly traditional family where there were certain expectations for the children, especially for the girls. An initial desire by Alatorre to pursue a medical career was met by some resistance in the family.

“My first choice was to study medicine, but my parents said that career ‘was not for girls and that it would keep you away from home too much,’” Alatorre recalled. “I don't really blame them; it was another culture, another generation and another mentality, where girls were raised only to be a mom and wife.”

[caption id="attachment_26168" align="alignleft" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2775-edit_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26168"><img class="wp-image-26168 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2775-edit_250px.jpg" alt="IMG_2775-edit_250px" width="250" height="390" /></a> Alatorre has been a competitive runner for many years.[/caption]

Her parents apparently were okay with a communications career, however, as she jumped into a university degree program with both feet. “Communications was a second career choice for me, but since it required a rather outgoing personality and a creative flair, I actually think it was tailor-made for me. So I went to college and studied for a communications degree.”

After college and after eventually settling in the states in 2000, Alatorre was offered a job by the popular and ubiquitous Berlitz world language company. “It was a job that I thought would keep me occupied as I adjusted to life in the states,” she said. “I was eventually trained and certified in the ‘Berlitz method,’ which is an immersion program of language for adults.”

She quickly began teaching Spanish more and more to people working in the business world and, after her boss told her that he thought she had the personality to teach children, she was offered an opportunity to teach them as well.

“At first I had my doubts, but I gave it a try,” she said. “I took the Berlitz Jr. immersion training method for kids and received official certification in it. Then I was sent by Berlitz to different schools in the Detroit metro area, including public, charter and private schools. So it was kind of a happy accident of destiny that I became a teacher. I love it and have stuck with it for the last 16 years!”

[caption id="attachment_26148" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9817_grad_300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26148"><img class="wp-image-26148 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_9817_grad_300px.jpg" alt="IMG_9817_grad_300px" width="300" height="240" /></a> Alatorre is with her son Danny and daughter Veronica, who graduated from the University of Michigan.[/caption]

Alatorre came to the Academy through a referral from a now-retired first grade teacher at GPA, and arrived with stellar references and experience that included many Berlitz assignments, including some in the Grosse Pointe Public School System as well as at the Neighborhood Club of Grosse Pointe. She also spent some time as an ‘on-call' interpreter assigned mostly to children cases that ranged from juvenile services, protective services, Vista Maria's foster care services to the Department of Immigration and for various courts.

According to Alatorre, when she first arrived on the GPA campus, she knew she had found a home.

“I immediately thought it to be a place where all of the faculty and staff were part of one big family,” she said. “The families of our students somehow seemed connected as an extended family of the faculty. Most of the teachers and students lived in the same community and the social and academic life was extremely busy during class hours and sometimes outside of the classroom. I remember saying at the time that it’s ‘the best organized chaos I’d ever seen.’ Scott Tily, who was principal at that time, laughed when I told him. He knew it was true as he had about 40 years himself working with young students. But it was — and still is — a wonderfully peaceful atmosphere of learning for both teachers and the kids.”

Outside the peaceful atmosphere of the Academy classrooms, however, this hard-working teacher has been a steady participant in running competitions and marathons for years. Alatorre was a competitive runner at the state level as a master female and also qualified at the national level in 2012 as a master female in the 5K. In 2011, she also won 3rd-place overall in her class in the 30K State Championship in Milford, Michigan.

Here he is being formerly promoted to the rank of sergeant.[/caption]

“I was training 60-85 miles a week for seven years,” she said, “but I didn't knew that I was overextending myself, and because of my bad natural running-gait mechanics, I ended up with a triple knee fracture that left me out of competitive running for good.”

She said she still loves outdoors and sports, but now she jog-walks very short distances and it seems she’s passed her passion for sports to her kids.

“They all either run, lift weights, play lacrosse, and one of my youngest did two kids’ triathlons,” she said. And Danny, my youngest, ran for a while with me but now likes biking. I really love outdoor activities and would gladly exchange a week at a 5-star hotel for a backpack hiking trip in the woods or trails.”

Meanwhile, back at The Grosse Pointe Academy, Alatorre talks more about her approach to the responsibilities of teaching young and impressionable middle school students. “I believe that all of us become ambassadors for our country, our school and for the communities in which we live,” she said, “whether that is in our culture or our language or in different ones. The students’ experiences with teachers like me who may have come from a different country can be a fulfilling experience that opens doors much wider for them to accept and understand other cultures and to work out any differences together as a team.

“Along with the regular Spanish lessons, I also try to teach my students about history, geography, climate and how people really live in other countries — without any stereotypes. I also want to encourage my students to travel whenever and wherever possible and to fully appreciate their role as positive ambassadors for their own local cultures.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>School makes more progress this summer on maintenance, preservation and beautification plans.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26175" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2820_ES-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26175"><img class="wp-image-26175 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_2820_ES-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="IMG_2820_ES-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="1330" /></a> Summer work on The Grosse Pointe Academy's Early School includes tuckpointing, a chimney rebuild and roof repair.[/caption]

Keeping up with The Grosse Pointe Academy’s beautiful and historic campus requires constant attention 12 months a year. But during the summer months when students and most of the faculty and staff are taking a much-deserved break, members of the Academy’s maintenance crew are working extra hard to get the buildings and grounds ready for Sept. 7, when the school’s first through eighth graders arrive, and Sept. 12, when the Early School kicks off.

“By far it has been the busiest summer of my 22-year career here,” said Kevin Alt, who manages GPA’s maintenance department. “We started the summer off by restoring our lawn sprinkler systems, which included replacing dozens of heads, fixing numerous underground leaks and repairing a number of wiring/timer issues.”

Alt noted that the front berm along Lake Shore Rd. at the front of the school has never been as green as it is now, especially given this very hot dry summer.

Visitors to the school this summer also likely noticed the scaffolding affixed to the outside of the Early School building. Alt said he had contracted with Grosse Pointe-based Madison Maintenance LLC on a big project that included tuckpointing the entire old section of the building, rebuilding its chimney and repairing the stairs. He said Madison will be redoing the Early School’s flat roof next week.

GPA’s internal maintenance crew also has been busy with repairing a large section of wall and rotted beams inside the entrance to the new section of the Early School, plus plastering and painting miscellaneous areas throughout the building.

“In addition, we removed the large overgrown evergreen bushes around the newer building and will be replacing them with smaller boxwoods and fresh mulch,” Alt said. “The children's garden received improvements as well.”

As a part of its strategic plan released in 2013, The Grosse Pointe Academy embarked on the first phase of an aggressive facilities-improvement plan that prioritized program needs and security as well as the historic preservation and beautification of campus buildings. Since then, more impressive progress has been made on other campus improvements, including those made this summer, the majority of which were made possible by the continued generosity of school friends and donors through the Academy’s annual Action Auction, most notably from the “paddle raise” at last year’s auction.

Other summer projects this year at the more than 120-year old campus, according to Alt, included moving the school’s innovative STEM lab to a different classroom, installing a new 8,000 CFM exhaust fan to provide better ventilation, repairing plaster, painting numerous walls as well as the usual summer work of polishing floors, cleaning carpets, and keeping up with the lawn and landscaping.

Alt also noted that the large barn on campus received a new roof during the summer and will get a new red paint job in the fall.

“In addition, we planted five new pear trees along the ‘nun’s walk’ area and installed metal edging around the garden areas to help control the intruding lawn,” Alt said.

“My crew works very, very hard all year round and takes a lot of pride in what they do,” he added. “There is a reason they are all in such good shape and wear running shoes to work!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we recently passed the birthday (Aug. 31) of Dr. Maria Montessori, founder of the Montessori method, one of the world’s most innovative education philosophies, The Grosse Pointe Academy, home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program, is pleased to offer four more quotes from this most innovative educator.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/four-colors_maria-feature_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26195"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26195" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/four-colors_maria-feature_1200px.jpg" alt="four-colors_maria-feature_1200px" width="1200" height="675" /></a>

“The child is capable of developing and giving us tangible proof of the possibility of a better humanity. He has shown us the true process of construction of the human being. We have seen children totally change as they acquire a love for things and as their sense of order, discipline, and self-control develops within them.... The child is both a hope and a promise for mankind.” <strong>(From Education and Peace, first published in 1949)</strong>

“We recognize the immense power, the unconscious forces existing in the child on the threshold of life. For many years we have been proclaiming that it is necessary to educate the child from the moment of birth. We have traced, through study and practical experience, the ideal path leading to the world of children, of these beings whose social status has as yet not been determined, whose rights have not been recognized and who nevertheless represent the world of tomorrow.” <strong>(From The San Remo Lectures, 1949)</strong>

“Do we believe and constantly insist that cooperation among the peoples of the world is necessary in order to bring about peace? If so, what is needed first of all is collaboration with children.... All our efforts will come to nothing until we remedy the great injustice done the child, and remedy it by cooperating with him. If we are among the men of good will who yearn for peace, we must lay the foundation for peace ourselves, by working for the social world of the child.” <strong>(From the Sixth International Montessori Congress in Copenhagen, 1937)</strong>

“Education should not limit itself to seeking new methods for a mostly arid transmission of knowledge: its aim must be to give the necessary aid to human development.... If ‘the formation of man’ becomes the basis of education, then the coordination of all schools from infancy to maturity, from nursery to university, arises as a first necessity: for man is a unity, an individuality that passes through interdependent phases of development. Each preceding phase prepares the one that follows, forms its base, nurtures the energies that urge towards the succeeding period of life.” <strong>(From Childhood to Adolescence, first published in 1948)</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Alum and business owner says the Academy helped set her up for success with company in Detroit</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26206" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gentry_RenCen_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26206"><img class="wp-image-26206 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gentry_RenCen_1000px.jpg" alt="gentry_RenCen_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy alum Carrie Gentry runs her business, Touch of Elegance Events &amp; Designs, out of Detroit's Renaissance Center.[/caption]

The wedding business is a $165-billion industry, with over 2.4 million weddings each year — and that’s just in the United States. Statistics show that the average wedding takes approximately 250 hours to plan, which is more than six full work weeks.

According to the American Association of Certified Wedding Planners (AACWP), preparing for a wedding is one of the most important — and stressful — tasks a couple will ever do.

The AACWP also says that in recent years, there has been an exponential growth in professional wedding planning for these stressed future brides and grooms. And one certified professional wedding and event planner in particular, who is located in Detroit, has been crazy busy with stressed “customers” — and she credits The Grosse Pointe Academy with helping her stay ahead of all the work.

“GPA not only prepared me for the rigors of high school work but it definitely taught me the priceless skills of time management and perseverance, which one needs in abundance in this business,” said Carrie Gentry, who graduated from the Academy in 2003 and is owner operator of Touch of Elegance Events &amp; Designs. “I love helping couples have a stress-free wedding day and making their dream designs a reality all while staying in their budget. Seeing happy couples on their special day never gets old!“

Gentry, who has planned weddings held in GPA’s chapel, said she’s looking to take her business beyond Detroit and Michigan as well. She currently is based downtown in Detroit’s Renaissance Center.

“My goal as a wedding planner/designer and business owner is to continue to provide excellent customer service and designs to our clients in the Detroit area,” she said. “But I also would like to expand and have Touch of Elegance hubs located in other major cities in the U.S.”

<strong>From fashion design to weddings</strong>

Gentry originally didn’t have wedding planning on her career bucket list when she first set foot on the campus of Savannah College of Art &amp; Design in Georgia. She was working toward a BFA in fashion marketing and management when one of her closest classmates asked her to design and coordinate her outdoor wedding with only found objects and a budget of $300 (including food!).

“That was quite possibly one of the hardest tasks anyone has ever asked me to do,” she recalled. “After the wedding concluded, the couple told me how elegant it was and how I really should make wedding planning a career.”

[caption id="attachment_26207" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gentry_seated-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26207"><img class="wp-image-26207 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gentry_seated-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="gentry_seated-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="1215" /></a> Gentry, who has planned weddings held in GPA’s chapel, said she’s looking to expand her business beyond Detroit and Michigan.[/caption]

So, even while continuing to pursue her education and career as a fashion designer, she dipped her toe in wedding and event planning during her senior year at SCAD.

“But after I graduated, I went back to pursuing a career in the fashion industry in Detroit,” she said. “However, my mother convinced me that Detroit was making a comeback and that this was the best time to get into wedding planning and design. She told me numerous times that there are always weddings happening in Detroit, but usually everyone has to go far out of the city to find a wedding planner.

“Of course, mom always knows best and Touch of Elegance Events &amp; Designs was born,” Gentry said. “I soon began to professionally design and plan weddings as well as make other specialty items for brides, such as veils and boleros, etc.”

<strong>Work ethic from GPA</strong>

Gentry attended high school at University Liggett. She said that if it wasn’t for some timely tutoring from an Academy teacher before getting into GPA, she may not have even attended GPA let alone Liggett.

“Before my first year at GPA began, which was in the middle school, I had to be tutored by Mrs. (Denise) Phelps all summer long,” Gentry said. “At first I was apprehensive because I was never very good at math. As the summer went on, I began to understand and actually grow to really like algebra. On the first day of school, I truly felt prepared and comfortable and was able to tackle any problem, math or otherwise. If it wasn't for Mrs. Phelps, I never would have survived!”

<strong>FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE ACADEMY’S <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/middle-school-preparation-for-life/" target="_blank">MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAM HERE</a>.</strong>

She also had a big shout out to another former GPA teacher (and coach).

“Mr. (Michael) Fultz, who constantly required the best out of me in school as well as in volleyball and tennis, taught me how to have good work ethic,” Gentry said. “He is one of the reasons why I also played both sports in high school — I actually was captain in both sports — and received numerous scholarships to college.”

<strong>The five key learning areas of Montessori</strong>

By Kylie D’Alton
<a href="http://www.howwemontessori.com/how-we-montessori/" target="_blank">How we Montessori </a>
July 27, 2016

It is clear that many parents don't know a lot about what goes on inside the Montessori classroom. There are, of course, parents who are very knowledgeable. So today, parent to parent, I thought I would briefly cover the five key learning areas in early Montessori.

In the home, I am aware of these areas and before my children started school full time, I definitely looked over and ensured we covered or touched on all of these areas. It really made me feel like we were delivering a whole range of activities.

While on our shelves I kept our materials together, in the classroom there are shelves and spaces for each area. In the classroom, you will find 'Practical Life' shelves and 'Maths' shelves. One of the important things to keep in mind in Montessori is that no area works in isolation. Practical life and sensorial exercises form the foundation for language and maths. Culture can be incorporated into all areas.

The five key areas of learning in the Montessori environment include; Practical Life, Sensorial, Language, Mathematics and Culture.

1. <strong>Practical life</strong> includes life skills to help develop independence, coordination, concentration, self-control, self-awareness, confidence and include:

- Care of Self (food preparation, dressing, washing),
- Care of Environment (cleaning, gardening, care of pets, environmentalism),
- Grace and Courtesy (greetings, manners, social interactions),
- Control of Movement (refining movements, walking the line, moving quietly).

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bd4a72041_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26225"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26225" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bd4a72041_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a72041_1000px" width="1000" height="655" /></a>

2. <strong>Sensorial</strong> activities allows the child to refine each of their senses:

- Sight (visual),
- Touch (tactile),
- Smell (olfactory),
- Taste (gustatory)
- Sound (auditory)
- Stereognostic (kinaesthetic).

Includes the manipulation of specifically designed materials that isolate qualities. Refines fine motor skills, visual and auditory senses and develops coordination and the ability to order and classify. Materials include Pink Tower, Brown Stairs, Knobbed Cylinders, Color Tablets.

3. <strong>Language</strong> is based on phonetic awareness. Children work through specific hands-on and tactile language materials such as the sandpaper letters to the moveable alphabet. Language is not an isolated topic but runs through the curriculum. The spoken language is the foundation for writing and then reading.

4. <strong>Mathematics</strong> is developed with the use of concrete learning materials. The sensorial area is the preparation for mathematics. Hands-on materials are used such as number rods, sandpaper numbers, number boards, spindle box, number tiles, beads, and games. Each exercise builds upon another and the child gradually moves to from concrete to abstract areas such as place value, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and fractions.

5. <strong>Culture</strong> allows the child to explore the natural world around them and includes:

- Geography (continents, landforms, earth layers, solar system),
- Zoology (classification, physiology of animals),
- Botany (ecology, classification, physiology of plants),
- History (time lines, using a calendar),
- Science.

Art and music could be considered cultural activities, however, creativity is encouraged across all curriculum areas. The cultural area is clearly identifiable by globes, puzzle maps, flags and perhaps images or materials from other cultures.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bd4a4833_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26224"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26224" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bd4a4833_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a4833_1000px" width="1000" height="880" /></a>

Most schools cover these areas with a bit of a description on their websites. While not completely necessary, I believe it helps to know the Montessori basics. When you walk into a Montessori classroom and can identify the areas, it all make sense!

<strong>New research says Pre-K provides significant benefits</strong>

<strong>Researchers working long-term with WVDE to assess student progress, classroom quality</strong>

(August 23, 2016) Rutgers University, NJ – First-year findings in a long-term National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) and Marshall University study of young students and early education classrooms (in West Virginia) reveal performance advantages among children attending Pre-K and provide useful information on classroom quality.

Results include:

• Children who attended Pre-K outperformed those who had no Pre-K experience in every measure
• Benefits of Pre-K were most profound in print knowledge
• Classroom quality averages all exceed minimal quality, and several demonstrate higher quality
• On average, classrooms demonstrated high quality in fostering a nurturing and safe environment

The initial West Virginia Universal Pre-K Evaluation showed, on average, children with Pre-K experience outperformed those without Pre-K in every measure. Benefits were “large and statistically significant,” with the widest margin in print knowledge.

“We recognize that our state’s future depends on early investment in our youngest citizens,” said State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Michael Martirano. “We must ensure that every child has access to high-quality preschool to build the foundation for success.”

In addition, the study scored both Pre-K and kindergarten classrooms above average for emotional support, such as fostering and nurturing and safe environment, and organization.

These findings are detailed in a new report, the first in a series spotlighting Pre-K education in West Virginia. NIEER is proud to partner with Marshall University on behalf of West Virginia Department of Education on this five-year study of how the state’s Universal Pre-K program affects child outcomes, with a specific focus on reading outcomes.

The study, launched in August 2015, includes 599 children starting Pre-K, and 573 children starting kindergarten who had attended Pre-K, in seven counties, Fayette, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Nicholas, Putnam, Roane and Wood. Researchers will follow the progress of these children through completion of third grade. About half the children are girls, more than 90 percent are white and about 73 percent are from low-income households. In upcoming years, additional students and families will be invited to participate.

Researchers evaluated skills including language, print knowledge, math, and executive functions such as memory, self-control, and attention.

High quality preschool education has been shown to close achievement gaps afflicting American children from minority and low-income families—and this study shows similar effects in West Virginia. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of children’s development over time, classroom environments and teaching practices across the participating counties, enabling WVDE to develop a data-driven approach to continuous improvement across all classrooms.

Researchers also are evaluating the quality of Pre-K and kindergarten classrooms, focusing on Pre-K and kindergarten rooms in the same seven counties. Evaluation includes both environmental factors and teacher-child interactions, measuring Space and Furnishings, Personal Care Routines, Language and Literacy, Learning Activities, Interaction, and Program Structure.

Results show a range of classroom quality, demonstrating some classrooms are of good quality and others have room for improvement. Teacher experience also varies, with Pre-K teachers generally having less experience teaching and fewer graduate degrees.

“We applaud West Virginia for its leadership in providing quality early learning opportunities,” said Shannon Ayers, Ph.D., associate research professor at NIEER. “We look forward to continuing our work with the West Virginia Department of Education and educators across the state to help achieve the best outcomes for children.”

Grosse Pointe Academy alum Jesse Paris Smith continues her advocacy for Pathway to Paris, which is a collaboration between musicians, artists, sustainability consultants, cities and activists to highlight solutions to climate change, and to help turn the Paris Agreement on climate change into real action.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has called on countries to present their respective instruments of ratification in New York on September 21. In an effort to “maintain the momentum” for the initiative, Smith, who is the daughter of music legend Patti Smith, helped organize a concert event on September 19 with a number of musicians and leading thinkers to highlight the importance of making the Paris accord real.

A video that was put together by Jesse Paris Smith recently in Detroit and publicizes the September event is available below.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>George Spica is studying art in London after attending NYU and completing residency in Iceland.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26393" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/portfolio-review-Mtg2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26393"><img class="wp-image-26393 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/portfolio-review-Mtg2_1000px.jpg" alt="portfolio-review-mtg2_1000px" width="1000" height="562" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy alum George Spica, right, undergoes a portfolio review while at Interlochen Arts Academy in northern Michigan.[/caption]

Grosse Pointe Academy alum George Spica (’11) is currently pursuing his art education in London where he attends the Slade School of Fine Art at University College, the highest ranked art school in the UK. This after the Interlochen Arts Academy graduate spent a year at New York University’s prestigious Steinhardt School in Manhattan.

“I found myself being taught things at NYU that I had already thoroughly covered at Interlochen, an experience I think many Interlochen alums have in college,” Spica said.

In an effort to step up the level of instruction, Spica received permission to take studio courses for upperclassmen so as to challenge himself further, even though he was only in his first year at NYU. However, he said, it wasn’t enough, and the general lack of opportunity for him there led him to look to other schools.

“I applied for transfer to smaller schools in the U.S., but the institutions that really caught my interest, particularly for their different approach to arts education, were those in the United Kingdom,” he said. “I was accepted to all the art schools to which I applied in London, and in May, I accepted a place in one of the BFA Fine Art courses at the Slade School at University College in London. University College is the founding college of the University of London, and is one of the most influential institutions in British higher education. I am very pleased with the prospect of studying art here as I find the urban environment vastly different from that of New York — much calmer and diverse.”

<strong>Academy academics helped set him up for success in high school and beyond</strong>

Spica attended The Grosse Pointe Academy from preschool to grade eight. He said that what he finally realized upon graduation from Interlochen was that the tradition and rigor that characterizes a GPA education is in fact what enabled him to engage in more unorthodox means of learning in his high school years.

“In other words, I was so comfortable and well-versed in my academics after graduating from the Academy,” he said, “I was far more open to the idea of alternative-learning methods as I matured in the context of an art school.”

<strong>MORE ON THE GROSSE POINTE ACADEMY’S ACADEMIC PROGRAM IS <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/ourprogram/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</strong>

After graduating from Interlochen in 2015, Spica had numerous offers for colleges and universities before he finally settled on NYU. He was accepted to the acclaimed Bard College in New York’s Hudson Valley and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was offered a substantial scholarship, but he thought New York University was the best fit for him at that time.

Now in a much better place at “The Slade” in London, he said he’s looking forward to greater things for his career, which seems to be already flourishing by most any measure.

“Outside of school, I have a couple of exciting things going on,” he said. “While in New York, I was accepted to an artist residency called Nes Listamiðstöð, which was held in Skagaströnd, a small town in North West Iceland. I spent this past June and July there in my own studio producing a new body of work, predominantly sculpture and video works.”

[caption id="attachment_26391" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spica-Iceland_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26391"><img class="wp-image-26391 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/spica-Iceland_1000px.jpg" alt="spica-iceland_1000px" width="1000" height="666" /></a> Above, from Spica’s work in Iceland. A portion of Spica’s artist statement says, “My work has always been physical, it was born out of an insular search for the limitations of my own body, but resulted in something far more comprehensive. Capitalizing on the conventional relationships between human consciousness and tactile objects, I have sought to evoke, within those relationships, simply what I perceive to be beautiful.”[/caption]

At the end of those two months, he curated a show composed of this new work in the residency’s gallery.

“I’m really pleased with this new work; it helped me recenter on my sculptural inclinations, something that drives my practice, and certainly something that was encouraged by the space and isolation that Iceland provides.”

Within the next three years, he said he will also be pursuing more substantial gallery representation in Europe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy social studies teacher says most important part of his job is encouraging students to make sound decisions for the public good.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26408" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clor-son-grad_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26408"><img class="wp-image-26408 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/clor-son-grad_1000px.jpg" alt="clor-son-grad_1000px" width="1000" height="1100" /></a> GPA social studies teacher Trevor Clor is with his son Benjamin after Ben's graduation from the Academy kindergarten.[/caption]

For GPA middle school teacher Trevor Clor, education was always his first choice for a professional career. And since he’s had a real passion for history and culture as long as he can remember, teaching always seemed like the best way to share his knowledge and learn more himself.

“When I was growing up, my parents were kind enough to plan our family vacations around visiting Civil War battlefields,” said Clor, who has been teaching at The Grosse Pointe Academy since 2009. “In fact, I’m fairly positive I was the only third grader at my school who dressed up as a Civil War cavalry soldier for Halloween.”

This former Civil War “soldier” also is fairly positive he teaches at the best school in southeast Michigan, if not the entire state.

“When I first came aboard at GPA, I was truly impressed with the community feel among the students, parents and staff here on campus,” he said. “GPA has a family atmosphere like no school I've ever seen.”

The Academy was not Clor’s first stop in his teaching career. He also spent time at Ferry Elementary in Grosse Pointe Woods and Hamtramck Charter Academy in Hamtramck.

“But without a doubt, along with its amazing academic program, GPA's buildings and grounds are stunningly beautiful,” he said. “It truly is the whole package and I get excited every day I come to work.”

Lawrence DeLuca, who is the Academy’s assistant head of school for instruction and principal for grades 1-8, said Clor’s enthusiasm is very evident.

“We are so excited to have Trevor teaching middle school social studies this year,” DeLuca said. “He truly has a passion for social studies and the excitement he brings to his classroom is almost palpable.”

Clor, who received his degree from Central Michigan University, also seems laser-focused on what he thinks is his primary responsibility on campus.

“By far, the most important part of my job at GPA is guiding my students to make informed, reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society,” he said. “That's a huge responsibility, but I'm confident that it can be accomplished for each student with the support of my colleagues on staff here as well as the entire school community.”

Since first arriving at the Academy “community” seven years ago, Clor said the school has seen tremendous improvement in its curriculum and its technology — especially its technology.

“The biggest change I've seen has been our updated technology. Converting to a Mac-based school and supporting 1:1 iPad use for all students was a massive undertaking that Megan Black and Robert Rochte navigated us through extremely well. The addition of the garden classroom also was a welcomed change. It adds life to our school like no other spot on campus.”

We asked Clor what he thought he might be doing with his life if he wasn’t educating children.

“If I wasn't a teacher, I think I would like to be a travel agent,” he said. “I absolutely live for adventure and travel. There's no better way to learn and understand people than by going out in the world and experiencing it for yourself.”

He said he’s been extremely fortunate in his relatively young life to have had the opportunity to travel all over the globe.

“However, there's always an exotic new location waiting just around the corner!”

When Clor is not on the GPA campus or traveling the world, he and his two sons, Benjamin and Matthew, can be seen snowboarding, eating at National Coney Island or cheering on the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings.

“Also, my parents have a residence on Higgins Lake in northern Michigan and another in Lakeland, Florida, which are two of my favorite places to visit,” he said. “Around the Pointes, my kids and I do a lot of playing outside and I’m always looking for live music somewhere.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Preparing a new generation of learners: State-of-the-school address to feature plans for the Academy.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd4a0220_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27286"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27286" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd4a0220_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0220_1000px" width="1000" height="714" /></a>

On Tuesday, Jan. 31, at 7 p.m., The Grosse Pointe Academy Head of School Tommy Adams will lay out future plans for the school and how they will positively affect the school’s current and future students.

“One of the things I will discuss for those attending on Jan. 31 will be a perspective on what I’ve observed and learned during my first six months as the Academy’s new head of school,” Adams said. “I also will talk about the effects of the current educational landscape on independent schools, and the plan to implement changes that will help improve the quality of the learning experience for our students and better position the Academy in the market.”

During the evening’s presentation, which is being called, “Preparing A New Generation of Learners at The Grosse Pointe Academy,” Adams said he also will present the school’s new vision for moving forward at GPA, which resulted from working with a select group of faculty and administrators over the past several weeks.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd4a3814_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27287"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27287" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bd4a3814_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a3814_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="731" /></a>

“There will be specific and concrete examples of programmatic change and revision to help enhance the learning and teaching that take place in the classroom at the Academy,” Adams said. “I believe that those attending this event definitely will want to hear about these changes and how it will positively impact their children’s experience at GPA. I look forward to seeing our many parents there.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Alum twins pursuing doctoral degrees say the Academy prepared them well for the rigors of high school and college.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26105" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26105"><img class="wp-image-26105 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-1_1000px.jpg" alt="twins 1_1000px" width="1000" height="636" /></a> Christian, left, and Christopher Love graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013.[/caption]

Christopher and Christian Love graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 2004. Since then, these identical twins have continued to blaze important and consequential trails in both high school and college, and it appears that the world at large also will benefit from their future “trailblazing.”

Christopher is currently pursuing his master’s degree in higher education at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. His long-term professional goals include higher education leadership as well as diversity and inclusion work for underrepresented minority students. He also plans to pursue and begin a doctoral program in higher education by 2018.

Christian is currently the “Leadership in Higher Education” M.Ed. program coordinator and a rising second-year doctoral student in higher education at the University of Washington College of Education in Seattle. He said his long-term professional goals include higher education leadership, but he also has a strong passion for teaching and advising students, as well as non-profit management.

“I often joke with my brother that one day we both will lead a college or university together with Christian serving as president and me serving as vice president for student life and diversity,” Christopher said.

[caption id="attachment_26104" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-2_300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26104"><img class="wp-image-26104 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-2_300px.jpg" alt="twins 2_300px" width="300" height="412" /></a> Christopher, at right, makes a strong point to his brother, Christian.[/caption]

Both Christopher and Christian received their undergraduate degrees from the University of Michigan. They enrolled at U-M after graduating from University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 2008 and both wanted to study pre-med and attend medical school after four years at Michigan.

“Unfortunately, we did not have a very strong science background in high school and were not passionate about the course load during our first two years at U-M,” said Christopher. “So after reflecting and talking with advisors and mentors, we both decided to concentrate in psychology with a minor in Afro-American and African studies. I think it’s because of our professional, personal and civic engagement experiences that we enjoy learning about people and understanding how the mind works and why individuals interact the way do.”

Christopher said that he also understood how to read people well and connect with them on an emotional level, which helped him develop good listening skills throughout life. “This connection to people at one point got me interested in becoming a psychiatrist,” he said, “I wanted to support families and communities by helping them process and work through their respective challenges and concerns.”

In Christian’s case, he decided to pursue psychology because of his mentoring and peer-support experiences.

“Having had the opportunity to mentor young people while in high school and serve as a support system for my friends and colleagues, I knew a change of academic scenery was imperative and important for me,” he said. “Being in a biology or chemistry lab no longer fulfilled my passion, so I decided to enroll in an introductory psychology course with Christopher and was inspired ever since.”

Both twins said that the Academy was key to getting them off to such a great start in both college and high school.

“Our transition from GPA to high school was rewarding, first of all, because we were introduced to diversity at such a young age,” Christian said. “Growing up in Detroit, we did not have much exposure to diverse populations and resources. But the Academy certainly prepared us physically, mentally, and emotionally to have those conversations about race and identity as well as how to interact and engage with diverse individuals through the lens of race, ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic status.”

[caption id="attachment_26103" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-5_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26103"><img class="wp-image-26103 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-5_1000px.jpg" alt="twins 5_1000px" width="1000" height="1013" /></a> Christopher, left, and Christian said that their educational experiences at the Academy definitely prepared them for high school and beyond.[/caption]

He said that during their time at the Academy, they were oftentimes taught to engage in class, support their classmates and seek help from teachers when needed.

“This certainly was a prime foundation for us once we began our high school tenure,” Christopher said. “Given our educational experiences at the Academy, we were definitely prepared for the academic rigor at U of D Jesuit because we immediately formulated ideal study skills and positive networks at the beginning of freshman year that carried over year to year.”

Due to their scholastic, athletic, artistic, and civic experiences at the Academy, the Love twins also were fortunate enough to get involved in numerous extracurricular activities in high school. Such opportunities, they said, included the high school football and track teams, a community service organization (the Christian Service Team), a young man of color organization (BASE-Black Awareness Society for Education) among several other clubs and organizations.

“BASE was a space for young men of color to pursue and facilitate professional development and community service opportunities as well as engage in dialogue about current events and societal facets affecting young men of color locally and nationally,” Christian said. “Plus, given our introduction to and ensuing passion for performing arts, we also had the privilege of performing in two high school musical productions, ‘Crazy for You’ and ‘Guys and Dolls.’ A big shoutout and much respect and admiration for (GPA teacher) Marion Chrisner for introducing us to such a beautiful art form while we were at the Academy.”

Besides Chrisner — who they said they loved because of her passion and pride in connecting with students through the performing arts — the Loves had high praise for all their teachers at the Academy, but they recalled a few more as being especially influential for them.

“Mr. Lapadot was another,” Christian said. “He inspired me to find my voice through reading and writing as well as by serving as a leader in the classroom. He also helped me develop an affinity for spelling and motivated me to represent my class in the school spelling bee. He served as a great mentor, leader, friend and support system for not only my brother and me, but for the entire Love family as a whole.”

Sasha (Ovshinsky) Murphy also was singled out by the twins. “Ms. Sasha inspired and motivated both of us to really consider our physical and emotional health while sparking our leadership potential in the gym and on the field,” Christopher said. “She also pushed us to aim high on our presidential fitness tests every year!”

[caption id="attachment_26102" align="alignright" width="296"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-6_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26102"><img class="wp-image-26102 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/twins-6_1000px-296x300.jpg" alt="twins 6_1000px" width="296" height="300" /></a> Christopher, left, and his twin brother, Christian, were born two months early and each weighed two pounds.[/caption]

So what was it really like growing up as identical twins? We asked.

They said the “twins” experience has been a phenomenal one and they’ve grown to be the best of friends, teammates and confidants.

“We are each other’s biggest supporter, critic, and ultimate competitor,” said Christopher. “Being known as ‘C1 and C2,’ ‘Love Brothers,’ ‘Love Twins,’ ‘Chris and Chris,’ and the ‘Brothers of Love’ also has shaped our collective journey in real and profound ways. As we finally embark on establishing our own separate identities, we still will continually uphold the values of ‘twinning’ and brotherhood.”

Living as identical twins for the last 26 years has been a rewarding and phenomenal experience for both of us, added Christian. “Being born two months premature, weighing only two pounds, and facing a number of adverse challenges along the way have motivated and inspired both of us,” he said. “I really believe this bond we share has inspired these two Detroit ‘miracle babies’ to become strong, committed and driven young men aspiring to become great leaders and advocates on a daily basis.”

So what does the future hold for “Chris and Chris?” Given their academic and professional experiences at U-M, Christopher and Christian both confirmed that they’ve settled on pursuing a career in higher education. They also noted that they both a got a bit of a head start when, after graduating from U-M in 2013, they served with City Year, an AmeriCorps education-based program that aims to support young people along their educational journey.

Christian served with City Year - Seattle/King County where he supported 8th-grade students in an English/language arts class for one year before pursuing his master’s degree at the University of Washington. Christopher served with City Year - Detroit where he supported 9th-grade students in an English/language arts class for one year before returning as a team leader for his second year with City Year - Detroit.

A busy couple of young men, to be sure, and if more proof is needed, we are providing a summary of only a few of the honors and accolades these two have accumulated in such a short time:

• Christian was a member of the National Honor Society, Cum Laude status (U of D Jesuit)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Five GPA teachers get innovation grants for 2016-17 school year.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26354" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Claudia_bd4a5067-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26354"><img class="wp-image-26354 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Claudia_bd4a5067-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="claudia_bd4a5067-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="645" /></a> Claudia Leslie teaches French at The Grosse Pointe Academy and chairs the school's professional development committee.[/caption]

The White House announced in September that more than $25 million in new grants is being awarded immediately by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to expand computer science education for all students. Part of that grant will go to professional development for teachers for instruction. NSF anticipates an additional $100 million investment to this initiative over the next four years.

While the NSF grant is focused on professional development for computer science instruction, continuous improvement for teachers in all subjects is a major focus for schools nationwide, public and private.

According to Learning Forward, a Dallas-based association advocating for educators, when parents of students are asked what they want for their children, there is overwhelming agreement that they want the best teacher possible in every classroom.

“The most important factor contributing to a student’s success in school is the quality of teaching,” the organization said in a report titled “Why Professional Development Matters.” While parents may not be familiar with this research, Learning Forward said they are united in their desire to ensure great teaching for their children every day.

And while professional engineers, designers and architects, etc., routinely congregate in seminars and workshops to share best practices, conduct research, and study trends and issues as part of their continuous career improvement, school teachers are no different. Those charged with educating children get together often for professional improvement, and school-sanctioned professional development (PD) days to stay on top of trends and technology that affect the work they do with students are an important part of that activity.

That is especially evident at The Grosse Pointe Academy, where a combination of on-campus and off-site PD days, seminars and classes contributes to making its faculty one of the most well-qualified and innovative teaching staffs in the state.

“Professional development is very important for the school, said Claudia Leslie, a grade 5 French teacher and language specialist at the Academy who also chairs the school’s professional development committee. “It is crucial for the teachers to keep up-to-date with technology for the classroom, new curriculum resources, and new research on how children learn. Inspired and informed teachers influence students achievement in many positive ways. And that's when exceptional learning takes place.”

In any given year, The Grosse Pointe Academy typically sponsors one main PD day in the fall and one in the spring. Teachers also use three days for professional development before the students return in the fall and two after they leave at the end of the year.

<strong>Innovation grants</strong>

Off-campus, there also are plenty of opportunities for GPA teachers to gain additional knowledge and skills.

“During the year, a number of our teachers visit schools across the country to gather and share ideas,” said Jennifer Kendall, assistant head of school for Early School education and admissions.

She said the Academy’s Innovation Grant program, which is funded in part by the school’s annual auction, is integral to the school’s success. “It’s main intent is to provide faculty and staff with opportunities to visit and learn from cutting-edge programs at other independent schools across the country,” Kendall said.

Leslie agrees that the IG program is critically important.

“It gives our faculty and staff opportunities for further professional development,” she said. “After the innovation grant recipients visit these other schools, they share their observations with the faculty and staff. They bring back new programs and instructional techniques that are oftentimes implemented at The Grosse Pointe Academy.”

This school year, five members of GPA’s faculty and staff were awarded innovation grants:

<strong>Cheryl Carroll</strong>, Early School–grade 3 physical education
<strong>Trevor Clor</strong>, grades 6–8 social studies, grade 6 grammar and composition
<strong>Claudia Leslie</strong>, grade 5 French, language specialist
<strong>Bridgette Murray</strong>, grades 6–8 language arts
<strong>Holly Willson</strong>, grade 5

Leslie, who is in her fifth year as chair of the PDC, said she’s very excited to be able to visit two schools in the San Francisco area this year as a result of her GPA innovation grant.

“I can't wait to share my observations and ideas with our faculty and staff!”

[caption id="attachment_26467" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CATCH_students_IMG_9143.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26467"><img class="wp-image-26467 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CATCH_students_IMG_9143.jpg" alt="catch_students_img_9143" width="1000" height="736" /></a> Academy students, from left, Lorie Savage, Courtney Mecke and Abby Keane will be emceeing the 2016 CATCH Night of Champions on October 19.[/caption]

Abby Keane, Courtney Mecke and Lorie Savage, middle school students at The Grosse Pointe Academy, have been chosen to emcee at the CATCH Night of Champions, which will be held Oct. 19 at The Henry Hotel in Dearborn.

It’s the ninth year in a row that Academy students have been chosen for the annual event, which this year inducts journalist, author and broadcaster Mitch Albom, TV news anchor Amy Andrews and commercial real estate developer Nathan Forbes into its hall of fame.

The Night of Champions helps benefit sick and needy children through the CATCH program, which was initiated in 1987 by former Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson. Specifically, CATCH (Caring Athletes Team for Children’s &amp; Henry Ford Hospitals) raises funds to help pediatric patients at Children’s Hospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Health System. The Academy has been been supporting CATCH since 2000.

Last year, Megan Driver and May Savage represented GPA as student emcees at the event, which inducted NFL Hall of Famer and Detroit native Jerome Bettis, Detroit Free Press publisher and president Joyce Jenereaux, and retired Ernst &amp; Young managing partner Al Lucarelli into its hall of fame. Since 1987, 89 men and women have been given the organization’s hall of fame award.

At this year’s event, CATCH also will present the Dr. Livingood Humanitarian Award to Henry Ford Health System's Dr. Tisa Johnson, who is medical director of the Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities.

The Academy Fund campaign kicked off the 2016-17 giving year with its seventh annual All-School Pancake Breakfast. More than 200 on hand this morning in the Tracy Fieldhouse enjoyed stacks of pancakes, sausage and fresh fruit while listening to a few brief messages from Tommy Adams, head of school, and Kristen Van Pelt, who leads the school’s development department.

According to Van Pelt, attendance was very good today at the kickoff and those on hand, which included many board members, heard that Academy Fund gifts directly support the mission of The Grosse Pointe Academy, which is “to nurture, challenge and inspire” its students.

[caption id="attachment_26488" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pancake-breakfast-016_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26488"><img class="wp-image-26488 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pancake-breakfast-016_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="pancake-breakfast-016_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="447" /></a> More than 200 people attended the Sept. 30 breakfast in the school's Tracy Fieldhouse.[/caption]

She said the school’s goal is to get a gift from every parent and reach 100% participation.

“Each year we rely very much on parent support to provide the transformative experience that is The Grosse Pointe Academy education,” she added.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pancake-breakfast-017_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26487"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26487" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pancake-breakfast-017_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="pancake-breakfast-017_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="736" /></a>

“A gift to the Academy Fund has an immediate impact on the current and future students of our school,” Van Pelt said. “When you give, you are helping to ensure excellence in our programs, facilities, professional development and technology. You are investing in our most important product — the student — who will graduate with the confidence to contribute and lead in our society.”

Van Pelt noted that a gift to the Academy Fund is also a strong statement to other potential donors that The Grosse Pointe Academy is well worth supporting.

On Friday, Oct. 14, first- through eighth-grade students at The Grosse Pointe Academy will be participating in the school’s annual CATCH Fun Run. GPA’s older students plan to run with their younger “buddies” from the lower grades at the event, which will be held at 2:30 p.m. on the Academy's soccer field.

“This year we decided to make the CATCH Fun Run a buddy event,” said physical education teacher and middle school dean of students Sasha Murphy, who is coordinating the Academy’s CATCH effort this year. “We sometimes struggle to find buddy time with all of the other school activities, and since the time was already set aside for five grades, we thought a school-wide buddy event would be fun.”

Murphy said that they are asking each student to bring in a $5 donation for CATCH by Thursday, Oct. 13. She said homeroom teachers will collect donations for first- through fifth-grade students and she herself will collect for sixth- through eighth-grade students.

<strong>About CATCH:</strong>
CATCH is dedicated to improving the quality of life for pediatric patients and their families at Children's Hospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Hospital. Through an ongoing series of special fundraising activities, CATCH provides needy children with support where they might otherwise fall through the cracks.

CATCH is an acronym for Caring Athletes Team for Children’s and Henry Ford Hospitals and was founded by the late Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson in 1987. Since that time, CATCH dollars from special events and donations have facilitated a steady stream of items and services that help improve the quality of life for thousands of needy children. Whether it be a bed monitor for a child who experiences dangerous seizures during the night or assisting families with utility and rent payments while taking time off work to help care for their sick child, CATCH funds are used in a reactionary manner where no other source of funding exists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Alum and mission-driven teacher at GPA says the future of the school she loves depends on the Academy Fund.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sasha_MUR01_edit-crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26510"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26510" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sasha_MUR01_edit-crop_1000px.jpg" alt="sasha_mur01_edit-crop_1000px" width="1000" height="937" /></a>

On a grey and rainy morning one early spring on The Grosse Pointe Academy campus, a decidedly upbeat and cheery figure was welcoming first graders to a special assembly in the big music room. Sasha Murphy, a physical education teacher and middle school dean of students at GPA, brought the kids into the first two rows of chairs set up for a presentation on recycling by Rizzo Environmental Services, whose representative was running a little late.

No worries, though, because Murphy kept the students properly engaged—she knows all the younger kids’ names even though she teaches mostly in the middle school. Rizzo’s Victoria Czapski eventually shows up and quickly begins leading the kids through the three Rs of environmental stewardship: reduce, reuse and recycle.

Murphy coordinated the event because among her many other duties on campus last year she was GPA’s Green School coordinator, a position from which she’s helped lead the school to seven straight official Green School designations. She obviously knows her way around this Green School and can probably walk blindfolded anywhere on campus without touching a wall. After all, she first set foot on the grounds of GPA in 1986, when she matriculated as a sixth-grade student herself.

<strong>Giving back</strong>

Murphy graduated from GPA in 1989 and after finishing high school and college, she said coming back to the Academy to work almost seemed predestined.

"When I had the offer to interview for a position at GPA, I jumped on it and was very excited," Murphy said. "I wanted to come back and be a part of the caring teachers and loving family environment that I experienced myself.”

It also helped that there were other rather strong connections to the Academy.

“My love for the school is a family affair,” she said. “My brother, Noah Ovshinsky, graduated in 1993 and my father, Harvey Ovshinsky (Mr. O.), taught creative writing here for 16 years. I am now entering my 19th year as a teacher here at GPA.”

They were married on the grounds of the Academy.[/caption]

Now an alumni spokesperson and representative for The Grosse Pointe Academy’s 2016-17 Academy Fund Drive, Murphy can’t think of anything as important as maintaining and sustaining the stellar education she herself received for many other generations of students to come.

“The Grosse Pointe Academy holds a place in all of our alumni hearts,” she said. “It helped form who we are today and forged friendships and relationships that have lasted through many years. The Academy Fund provides essential support to GPA, without which the school could not exist. Although it may slip to the back of our minds as time passes, we all smile when we think back to our GPA days and how thankful we are for the experiences and memories our Academy Advantage provided us.”

<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/support-gpa/the-academy-fund/" target="_blank">MORE INFORMATION ON THE ACADEMY FUND IS AVAILABLE HERE.</a></strong>

Murphy noted that because the Academy is a privately funded school, it allows her and the rest of the faculty and staff to educate today's GPA students in an environment that provides to students special and unique academic challenges, a nurturing through faith and ethics, and inspiration enough to sing a solo in the class play, join the soccer team even if they’ve never played before, produce an amazing piece of artwork, and spend their school days with teachers who care for them just as her teachers cared for her when she was their age.

“And giving back to GPA through the Academy Fund helps ensure that a new generation of students experience the same love and care we did as students,” she said.

<strong>This is ‘how you teach children’</strong>

“GPA is still the amazing place I remember as a student,” Murphy said, “and it continues to instill life-changing experiences and relationships in its students and teachers each and every day.”

When Murphy first started on staff at the school, she loved that the students were immersed in so many things—art, music, athletics, many other extracurriculars and of course, the academics. "Truly something for every type of student," she said. "To me, this was how you teach children."

According to Murphy, teaching children was always part of her life plan.

"Believe it or not, I have consciously known since first grade that I wanted to be a teacher,” she said. “And I started working with children by babysitting in middle school, then became a camp counselor in high school and college, assistant camp director, camp director and then finally a teacher here at GPA."

<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/support-gpa/the-academy-fund/" target="_blank">MORE INFORMATION ON THE ACADEMY FUND IS AVAILABLE HERE.</a></strong>

In high school, Murphy took child development classes and worked in a day-care center at Grosse Pointe South. In college, she majored in psychology and elementary education and earned a master’s in early childhood education.

"However, I did not ever think my educational career would be with adolescents," she said. "I always thought I would be an elementary teacher. But after a few months of teaching middle school PE here at GPA in 1998, I fell in love with the older kids and have not looked back."

"I really enjoy helping them, teaching them, addressing their struggles and celebrating their triumphs. I love the fact that they seem to always have such a sense of wonder, love of life and excitement."

Lawrence DeLuca, GPA’s assistant head of school for instruction and principal for grades 1-8, said Murphy is a real advocate for the students. “Sasha is one of the most dedicated teachers I have ever met,” he said. “She is or has been our P.E. teacher, community service coordinator, NJHS faculty advisor, Student Council advisor, 6th-Grade advisor, and now middle school dean.”

DeLuca said Murphy at times is like a second parent to many of the kids. “Every day, she meets with students after school to help them get organized with their homework and get caught up with their work.”

<strong>Driving the mission</strong>

The mission of The Grosse Pointe Academy and its faculty and staff is based on three central tenets: “to nurture, to challenge and to inspire” students. In Murphy’s case, it’s hard to see where any of that doesn’t apply.

“I am a total cheerleader for my students,” she said. “I am on their team no matter what. If they get an A+ or fail a test or are having a really crummy day, no matter what, I am there for them.”

Some kids might just need a hug, she said, some might need help with their homework, or staying organized, or working on improving their citizenship or help remembering to do certain things.

You can find Murphy after school three to five days a week, working with those students who need help. She also offers a study hall for middle-school students.

And she’s a firm believer in practicing what she is preaching to her students.

“As the school’s community service coordinator, it was important to me that the kids know I also did community service in my own free time, that I made it a part of my life as well. And, if I’m asking them to speak politely to each other, they needed to see that I do the same with students and other adults. I am always pushing my students, challenging them to get out of their comfort zone.”

Murphy has herself taken on some challenges of her own with some pretty tough fitness classes and she’s working on being a regular runner whenever she’s not at school.

<strong>Psychologist?</strong>

It’s difficult to imagine Sasha Murphy in a different field of work, and when asked what she might be doing if she wasn’t in education, she also has kind of a hard time coming up with something at first.

But when pressed, she said: “In no particular order, private practice or school psychologist, some sort of life coach but more for teens, events coordinator, physical therapist, public relations for a city. . .”

All noble professions. But the Grosse Pointe Academy and its students and staff certainly are glad Murphy has instead dedicated her career to educating those who, like her, will one day make their own mark in the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Grosse Pointe Academy alum and first woman to coach high school boys hockey in New Jersey to be inducted into ULS hall of fame.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26520" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26520"><img class="wp-image-26520 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh2_1000px.jpg" alt="hishmeh2_1000px" width="1000" height="612" /></a> Now heading into her fourth year of coaching the Montville High School boys hockey team, GPA alum Meghan (Brady) Hishmeh has taken the Mustangs to consecutive winning records.[/caption]

The Montville (N.J.) High School Mustangs boys ice hockey team opens its 2016-17 campaign with a non-conference game on Nov. 26 at Sparta High School in Sparta, New Jersey. But the 4th-year head coach of the team and the first woman to ever coach a high school boys hockey team in the state has some personal business to attend to before then.

Tonight, October 7, Meghan (Brady) Hishmeh, a 1985 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, will be inducted into the University Liggett School’s Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame in a ceremony to be held at the Grosse Pointe Woods school. Hishmeh will be honored along with three other Knight alums.

Even though she drove through the night on Wednesday from her home in New Jersey to get to Michigan for her hall of fame induction, Hishmeh was able to spend a few minutes answering a couple of questions from the Academy.

<strong>Prepared</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26521" align="alignright" width="240"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh4_hat_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26521"><img class="wp-image-26521 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh4_hat_350px-240x300.jpg" alt="hishmeh4_hat_350px" width="240" height="300" /></a> Hishmeh will be inducted into the University Liggett School Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame.[/caption]

She’s likely going to be well-prepared to speak and accept her award at tonight’s event — despite the long drive. It seems she’s been well-prepared for just about anything that’s come her way, including her academic career, which began for her as a three year old in the Early School at the Academy.

“I started with Ms. Shaw in the Early School and graduated in 1984,” said Hishmeh, who also had big shout-outs for some of her GPA teachers. “I loved Mrs. Candler, Mr. Tily, Mrs. Chrisner, Miss Fetterman, Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Connolly, Mrs. Franco and Mr. Lapadot.”

She said that the Academy prepared its students well to transition to any size or type of high school.

“Academically, I felt I was extremely prepared, especially in science, French, math and English,” she said. “Coming into a private high school like Liggett, the academic expectations were high and I felt I was ready.”

In fact, Hishmeh enrolled in math and French honors-level courses at ULS and handled it comfortably, she said.

“Also, joining lots of clubs and sports teams in high school was a natural transition for me as the Academy always encouraged you to try multiple activities that may have been new or unfamiliar.”

<strong>Olympics referee</strong>

As with any athletic hall of fame induction, it’s fair to wonder why someone is so honored. In Hishmeh’s case, there is no wonder. That’s because it is plainly obvious why this mother of three, post-op orthopaedic surgery nurse, part-time referee, substitute school nurse and head coach of a high school hockey team is being inducted tonight.

A hockey player herself since she was six years old in Grosse Pointe, she played youth hockey before playing three years at ULS after the school started a girls hockey team during her sophomore year. Hishmeh also played field hockey, soccer and was a member of the Liggett’s swim team.

She continued her hockey career after high school at the University of Vermont, leading the team in scoring (and penalty minutes) as she earned a nursing degree.

After graduating from U-V, Hishmeh moved to Colorado for work. It’s also where she began to coach hockey, first with mites, who she taught the very basic fundamentals of the sport. When a job change brought her to New Jersey, she picked up the girls hockey coaching job at Princeton Day, a private high school in Princeton. It was at that time when she also began to referee the sport she loved so much.

[caption id="attachment_26522" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh1_bench_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26522"><img class="wp-image-26522 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh1_bench_1000px.jpg" alt="hishmeh1_bench_1000px" width="1000" height="749" /></a> Hishmeh graduated from the University of Vermont and when she's not behind the hockey bench, she works as a post-op orthopaedic surgery nurse at St Clare’s Hospital in Denville, N.J.[/caption]

As a coach, Hishmeh figures she’s been behind the bench for more than 20 years. But on the other side of the boards, she thinks she’s been officiating for nearly the same amount of time, including working a number of games in which her sons were playing and, quite spectacularly, serving as a linesman during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

So now, as she looks forward to the upcoming hockey season at Montville, Hishmeh again has very high expectations. That’s because her teams have been winning and performing well since she’s been in charge. In fact, before she took over the Mustangs, the team had not had a winning record since the 2008-09 season.

<strong>Valuable lesson</strong>

Meanwhile, getting back to her time at The Grosse Pointe Academy, Hishmeh said that besides the wonderful academic start she received at GPA, there is something even more important that she walked away with after graduating from the school.

[caption id="attachment_26541" align="alignleft" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh-kids2_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26541"><img class="wp-image-26541 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hishmeh-kids2_250px.jpg" alt="hishmeh-kids2_250px" width="250" height="214" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy alum Hishmeh is with her three sons.[/caption]

“I believe that GPA has influenced me in many ways in my life and career, but I think what has been most important is that at the Academy, you were always taught to treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself. That has been huge for me.”

[caption id="attachment_26549" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_6718a-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26549"><img class="wp-image-26549 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_6718a-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="img_6718a-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="717" /></a> Fran Williams, left, a 1969 alum, shows 2005 graduate and NFL receiver Bennie Fowler her yearbook at the Denver Broncos' Training Facility near Denver, Colorado.[/caption]

An article in the most recent edition of “The Academic,” The Grosse Pointe Academy’s biannual magazine for alumni and the school community, got the instant attention of 1969 alum Fran (Fitzgerald) Williams.

“I work for the Denver Broncos and could hardly believe my eyes when I saw a picture of a very familiar-looking football uniform mid-magazine,” said Williams, who was a member of the last class of the Academy of the Sacred Heart before the school transitioned to become GPA.

The article she is referring to was about 2005 GPA graduate and Broncos wide receiver Bennie Fowler, who was instrumental in getting his team into the AFC championship game last season. Fowler prepped at Detroit Country Day and played college ball for the Michigan State Spartans after which he signed as a free agent with Denver in 2014. The Broncos beat New England in the AFC championship game last season and went on to become Super Bowl champions by defeating the Carolina Panthers.

Williams works for the Broncos’ Stadium Management Company, LLC (SMC), a subsidiary of the Denver Broncos Football Club. SMC manages all aspects of the team’s Sports Authority Stadium, which is where the Broncos play all of its home games. She said she spends most of her time at the stadium and unless its a home game, she rarely sees Fowler since the team practices a few miles away.

This week, with the help of the Broncos’ PR staff, the Academy coordinated a get-together of Williams and Fowler. They met at the team's training facility and exchanged memories of their shared school and campus on Lake Shore Road. Williams even brought along her 1969 ASH yearbook that Fowler gladly signed.

“Mine was the last high school graduating class from the Academy of the Sacred Heart in 1969,” Williams said. “It certainly never occurred to me then, or since then, that a pro football player and I would share the same alumni association!”

Williams also called out a couple of other alums after reading The Academic magazine.

“Alumni Association President Roselie Posselius’s article was a welcome reminder of the common roots and value system shared by ASH and GPA alums,” she said. “Also, the title of the article on 1980 alum James Cargas, ‘Academics, respect and manners,’ was nearly a complete summation of what began in pre-K and continued through lower and middle school. I would just add the word ‘faith.’

“Reading the magazine was a real walk down memory lane for me and a heartwarming reminder of the values that I learned early and still treasure to this day.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an article published by Investor’s Business Daily, journalist Nancy Gondo discusses education pioneer Maria Montessori and how her innovative academic philosophy has transformed education worldwide and influenced generations of successful Montessori alums, including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

<strong>Maria Montessori Stands At The Head Of The Class</strong>

By NANCY GONDO, INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY

If you think Google (GOOG) co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon.com (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos and music producer Sean Combs have much in common, you're right.

They can all thank Maria Montessori (1870-1952), at least a little, for their success.

Montessori's philosophy toward child development and learning lets children pursue their interests as they evolve, instead of forcing them into a strict regime.

Given the above examples, it's no surprise this style of teaching is a popular method used in schools around the world. Other Montessori alumni include Julia Child, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.

"Some of these famous people have attributed Montessori to their ability to think outside the box," Kathy Roemer, board president of the American Montessori Society and executive director of a trio of Montessori preschools in New York City, told IBD via email. "Montessori offers environments that are stimulating, safe and nurturing, where children are comfortable taking learning risks.

"In addition, mistakes are considered opportunities for learning to take place. Children are able to enhance the abilities they are born with while exploring other areas of challenge."

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bd4a0223-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26566"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26566" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bd4a0223-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0223-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="800" /></a>

That may be a reason the Montessori method thrives globally. The International Montessori Index, which provides school and training center information, estimates a worldwide presence of 7,000 Montessori institutions.

"Montessori remains especially relevant today," Virginia McHugh Goodwin, executive director of the U.S. branch of the International Montessori Association, said via email. "Neuroscience consistently proves this, and science has finally caught up with Montessori. It is a brain-based developmental approach to learning."

<strong>The Pillar</strong>

That Maria Montessori discovered a new way of teaching and built it into a viable business was no surprise, given her strong will. Even at elementary school in Rome, she took on a leadership role, finding activities for younger kids to do and making up games.

Maria loved math and science. By the time she was 12, she'd decided to become an engineer. Her accountant father, Alessandro, strongly opposed. Girls back then became teachers — if they worked at all.

But her mother, Renilde, understood Maria wanted to break away from the old-fashioned ideals. And like Maria, she was persistent.

"She finally persuaded her husband to allow their headstrong, talented girl to follow her dream," Marie Tennent Shephard wrote in "Maria Montessori: Teacher of Teachers." "Both mother and daughter had the same stubborn streak. Alessandro was no match for them."

In 1883, 13-year-old Maria enrolled as one of two female students at a technical school. She graduated three years later, then attended another technical institute for further learning. While there, she changed her aim to medicine.

Her father balked. Another hurdle arose when the head of the University of Rome's medical department told Maria a medical school would never admit a woman.

She enrolled for premed classes anyway — then wrote letters, sent referrals from teachers and asked friends for help to gain acceptance to a med school.

<strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/is-your-child-ready-for-preschool/" target="_blank">IS YOUR CHILD READY FOR PRESCHOOL?</a></strong>

Her persistence paid off. That year she became the first female medical student at the University of Rome. She heard grumbling from the male students. But by the second year, she'd won them over with her pluck and drive. On July 10, 1896, 25-year-old Montessori became Italy's first female doctor.

The University of Rome hired her as a children's doctor. She also became an assistant doctor at the university's psychiatric clinic, where she observed mentally disabled kids. After researching, she realized they needed special education, not medical treatment.

Word spread about Dr. Montessori's findings. Italy's public education minister asked her to give lectures to Rome's teachers about how to educate children with learning disabilities. By 1900 she was a director of the Orthophrenic School, founded to help educate mentally disabled children.

She taught pupils via simple motions like using a spoon or walking on a straight line. She also focused on the senses — vision, smell and touch — to help kids learn to read and write. Within two years, some of them could pass a school exam.

<strong>In Their Heads</strong>

The doc thought her methods could help normal children too. She studied philosophy and psychology and sat in elementary school classrooms to observe what the pupils were learning.

"Maria Montessori was a scientist who used her uncanny ability of observation to determine how children learn through discovery and doing," Roemer said.

When asked if she would take care of 50 preschoolers at a slum in Rome, she jumped at the chance to try her method on normal kids.

To help foster independence, she had child-size furniture built. Cupboards, chalkboards, shelves and washstands were placed at children's height. And in 1907, Casa dei Bambini (Children's House) opened, offering free care to working parents of 2- to 6-year-olds living in the tenement.

To teach using the senses, she filled bottles with scents (smell and taste) and boxes with sand and stones (sound and touch).

"The Montessori method uses the senses, through which all information travels for young children," Roemer said. "Her use of hands-on materials reinforces the discoveries the children are making as they are learning."

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bd4a0055-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26565"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26565" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bd4a0055-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0055-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="835" /></a>

The kids preferred her creations, such as knobbed cylinders and wooden dressing frames to practice lacing, tying bows and fastening hooks, to traditional toys like dolls and balls.

They learned on their own how to build, sort or arrange objects the right way. This helped them gain independence and self-confidence. Montessori let them learn at their own speed.

Within a few weeks, they'd blossomed from anti-social, rebellious children into happy, well-behaved students who wanted to learn.

<strong>Vocabulary Game</strong>

Next Montessori taught them to read using homemade letters, which they arranged on a mat to form words while learning the sounds of each.

"A skillful Montessori teacher is trained to continually assess what stage a child is at in their development and to map out individualized pathways inside the classroom to meet each child's needs," McHugh said. "Children thrive in Montessori because their developmental needs are consistently met and satisfied, enabling them to become joyful and successful learners."

The school was such a success, another opened in April 1907 in a nearby tenement. More Montessori schools soon sprouted up throughout Rome, then beyond. Queries poured in from around the world, asking about her method.

She immersed herself in her work, training teachers and creating classroom materials. Soon she was earning enough money to support herself and her family off her book and course proceeds.

The Montessori method became a thriving business. In 1911 McClure's Magazine featured her teaching method, piquing the interest of Americans.

A year later telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell and his wife helped form the Montessori American Committee, which organized the first international training course in Rome.

Montessori came to America to promote her method. She gave a lecture to a packed room at New York's Carnegie Hall. She concluded: "The development at which I aim includes the whole child. My greater aim is the eventual perfection of the human race."

In 1929 she formed the International Montessori Association in Amsterdam to supervise schools worldwide and maintain control of her method and materials.

Montessori died at age 81 in Noordwijk, Holland, where she was buried.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Compassion teams up with creativity for 2003 alum: New York writer, poet says the Academy’s foundation and values continue to be big in her career and life.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26577" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-2-Academy-Lawn_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26577"><img class="wp-image-26577 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-2-Academy-Lawn_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="photo-2-academy-lawn_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="1001" /></a> Chelsea Baumgarten, a 2003 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, says the foundation she received at the school has been enormously helpful to her in her life and career.[/caption]

Chelsea Baumgarten is a successful writer and poet living and working in New York City. She’s been published in numerous prestigious peer-reviewed journals, and her college career has included many awards and rewards.

But this 2003 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy sees much of her success thus far rooted in the time she spent on the campus of GPA.

[caption id="attachment_26580" align="alignright" width="225"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Baungarten_School-Photo_edit_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26580"><img class="wp-image-26580 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Baungarten_School-Photo_edit_350px-225x300.jpg" alt="baungarten_school-photo_edit_350px" width="225" height="300" /></a> Baumgarten as a student in the Academy's Early School.[/caption]

“The Academy certainly prepared me for high school and beyond,” said Baumgarten. “Academically, of course, across all subjects, GPA is phenomenal. Beyond that, though, the Academy always encouraged creativity and compassion. There’s something magical about the building and the grounds, and the curriculum actively nourished creative thinking.”

Baumgarten started at the Academy as a preschooler and after graduating, spent four years at University Liggett School. She then enrolled at Kalamazoo College, where she majored in English and psychology, and graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa with honors in both majors. In addition, the psych department at Kalamazoo College gave her awards for “excellence in research” and “excellence in coursework,” and the English department awarded her for “excellence in critical essay writing.”

<strong>Writing a career</strong>

With grad school on the horizon, Baumgarten was fairly certain she would continue with her studies in psychology and pursue a career as a clinical psychologist. But writing and literature also was tugging on her arm.

“I was a teaching assistant for a few psychology courses at KC and also a research assistant in a cognitive psychology lab,” she said. “I even interned at a psychiatric hospital for a summer. I loved psychology – and still do – but ultimately couldn’t ignore my passion for literature and creative writing, so I decided to pursue a graduate degree in English instead. I think literature and psychology complement each other nicely, though, and I’m so happy that I’ve studied both. To this day, I think my psych background definitely informs my creative writing.”

Baumgarten enrolled at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2013 and earned an MA in English literature. While at UIC, she interned in publishing at Chronicle Books, a publisher in San Francisco.

After finishing up at UIC, she began in earnest to prioritize her own writing projects, which included turning one of her graduate school term papers about the author Vladimir Nabokov’s work into an academic article that eventually was published in The Nabokov Online Journal, a peer-reviewed journal that specializes in Nabokov.

“At that time, I started to set aside time every day to write poetry and fiction,” she said. “In the spring of 2015, I was awarded a poetry fellowship to attend the Indiana University Writers’ Conference, where I was able to study with two of my favorite poets. Finally, in September of 2015, I took the plunge and moved to New York City.”

[caption id="attachment_26579" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-1-NYC_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26579"><img class="wp-image-26579 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Photo-1-NYC_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="photo-1-nyc_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="935" /></a> Baumgarten moved to New York City in September of 2015.[/caption]

In New York, Baumgarten works primarily as a freelance writer and has published articles about business and literary news. But she continues with her real passion — writing fiction and poetry, which ultimately led to her getting two poems published recently in online journal, The Grief Diaries.

“In many ways, living in New York is a writer’s dream,” Baumgarten said. “There’s always something literary going on – author readings, talks, writing classes, exhibits at museums – and you’re in close proximity to so many people from different backgrounds. And I’ve become friends with a lot of other writers in various stages of their careers here, too.”

Currently, she said, she’s working on a short story that’s set in Michigan.

“I love to travel and have lived in a variety of places, but my imagination is still very drawn to Michigan and the Great Lakes.”

<strong>Volleyball dynasty</strong>

Now well-entrenched in one of the world’s epicenters of culture and literature, New York City, Baumgarten nonetheless cannot forget where it all began.

“I have tons of wonderful GPA memories,” said Baumgarten, who grew up in the City of Grosse Pointe and has a brother, Kurt, who also graduated from GPA (2001). “The one memory that comes to mind immediately is playing on the middle school volleyball team. To this day, Mr. (Michael) Fultz was one of the best coaches I’ve ever had. When I joined varsity in 7th grade, the team had been undefeated for fourteen years or something crazy like that. Mr. Fultz never put pressure on us to win for the sake of maintaining the record, though. He just wanted us to continue to improve and communicate and try our best. It was so much fun to learn to play a new sport from a very talented coach and be part of a program with such a strong history.”

Baumgarten continued to play volleyball through high school and also at Kalamazoo College during her freshman and sophomore years. She still plays in adult recreation leagues and has even tried her hand in coaching.

“Right after I graduated from grad school, I coached a middle school volleyball team for a season,” she said. “I definitely tried to channel Mr. Fultz while I was coaching. Sometimes I would have my team do the same drills that Mr. Fultz had us do, and I’d always tell them, ‘I did this drill when I was your age! It works!’”

She said she actually ran into Fultz while she was coaching her own team. “He was refereeing one of our games. It was a very happy reunion!”

<strong>Important Academy values</strong>

Summing up her Grosse Pointe Academy experience, Baumgarten said that doing your own thing and doing it creatively was always encouraged at school with one very important caveat. It had to be done respectfully.

“Whether it was in creative movement with Ms. Denise, music class with Mrs. Chrisner, or creative writing with Mr. O, I always got the sense that it was okay to do things your own way and use your imagination, as long as you were respectful of others,” she said. “That was an important value the Academy taught me: you should be respectful and considerate of others and make an effort to understand them.

“I think that foundation has been enormously helpful to me both in my life and in my writing.”

One hundred and five years ago this month the first Montessori school in North America opened in Tarrytown, New York. It wasn’t long before a second was opened by inventor Alexander Graham Bell and his wife near their home in Canada.

Today, there are more than 4,500 Montessori schools in the United States and about 20,000 worldwide.

The Grosse Pointe Academy, which is home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program, is pleased to offer four quotes from Dr. Maria Montessori, founder of the Montessori method, arguably the world’s most innovative education philosophy. Enjoy!

“Education should not limit itself to seeking new methods for a mostly arid transmission of knowledge: its aim must be to give the necessary aid to human development.... If ‘the formation of man’ becomes the basis of education, then the coordination of all schools from infancy to maturity, from nursery to university, arises as a first necessity: for man is a unity, an individuality that passes through interdependent phases of development. Each preceding phase prepares the one that follows, forms its base, nurtures the energies that urge toward the succeeding period of life.” <strong>(From Childhood to Adolescence, first published in 1948)</strong>

“We must clearly understand that when we give the child freedom and independence, we are giving freedom to a worker already braced for action, who cannot live without working and being active.” <strong>(From The Absorbent Mind, first published in 1949)</strong>

"The child must see for himself what he can do, and it is important to give him not only the means of education but also to supply him with indicators which tell him his mistakes……The child’s interest in doing better, and his own constant checking and testing, are so important to him that his progress is assured. His very nature tends toward exactitude and the ways of obtaining it appeal to him." <strong>(From The Absorbent Mind, first published in 1949)</strong>

"The child has to acquire physical independence by being self-sufficient; he must become of independent will be using in freedom his own power of choice; he must become capable of independent thought by working alone without interruption. The child’s development follows a path of successive stages of independence." <strong>(From The Absorbent Mind, first published in 1949)</strong>

Grosse Pointe Academy alum David Scupholm (’13), a senior at Grosse Pointe South High School, has been named a semifinalist in the latest edition of the National Merit Scholarship competition. Scupholm and the three other South students who were named NMSC semifinalists now have an opportunity to continue in the competition for one of the 7,500 National Merit Scholarships worth nearly $33 million that will be offered the this Class of 2017.

Scupholm, who graduates from South in the spring, attained semifinalist status by scoring in the top 1 percent of U.S. high school students who took the Preliminary SAT test. He currently has narrowed his college search to a number of small liberal arts schools and plans to major in business or pre-law

<strong>More than a million juniors</strong>

Last school year, more than 1.4 million juniors in more than 22,000 high schools entered the 2017 National Merit Scholarship Program by taking the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT), which served as an initial screening of program entrants. The nationwide pool of semifinalists, representing less than one percent of U.S. high school seniors, includes the highest scoring entrants in each state. The number of semifinalists in a state is proportional to the state’s percentage of the national total of graduating seniors.

About 90 percent of NMSC semifinalists are expected to attain finalist standing and more than half of the finalists will win a National Merit Scholarship, earning the Merit Scholar title. To be considered for the Merit Scholarship, semifinalists must fulfill several additional requirements to advance to the finalist level of the competition.

To become a finalist, the semifinalist and his or her high school must submit a detailed scholarship application in which they provide information about the semifinalist’s academic record, participation in school and community activities, demonstrated leadership abilities, employment, and honors and awards received. A semifinalist must have an outstanding academic record throughout high school, be endorsed and recommended by a high school official, write an essay, and earn SAT scores that confirm the student’s earlier performance on the qualifying test.

</a></strong>NMSC, a not-for-profit organization that operates without government assistance, was established in 1955 specifically to conduct the annual National Merit Scholarship Program. Scholarships are underwritten by NMSC with its own funds and by approximately 440 business organizations and higher education institutions that share NMSC’s goals of honoring the nation’s scholastic champions and encouraging the pursuit of academic excellence.

According to NMSC, the National Merit Scholarship Program honors individual students who show exceptional academic ability and potential for success in rigorous college studies. The program does not measure the quality or effectiveness of education within a school, system or state. For more information about the competition, visit www.nationalmerit.org.

[caption id="attachment_26611" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CATCHnight1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26611"><img class="wp-image-26611 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CATCHnight1_1000px.jpg" alt="catchnight1_1000px" width="1000" height="760" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy students, from left, Abby Keane, Lorna Savage and Courtney Mecke are with GPA head of school Tommy Adams at the 2016 CATCH Night of Champions, held October 19 at The Henry hotel in Dearborn.

Academy middle school students Courtney Mecke, 8th grade, Lorna Savage and Abby Keane, both 7th grade, were honored to serve October 19 as special student emcees during the 2016 CATCH Night of Champions held at The Henry hotel in Dearborn.

This annual dinner and auction includes the CATCH Hall of Fame induction ceremony for community leaders in recognition of their charity work over the past year.

It’s the ninth year in a row that Academy students were chosen for the annual event, which this year inducted journalist, author and broadcaster Mitch Albom, TV news anchor Amy Andrews and commercial real estate developer Nathan Forbes into its hall of fame.

Albom noted in his speech that the three students from the Academy did a great job during the evening. “To the girls reading here tonight,” he said, "you are fantastic and wonderful examples of what this is all about.”

The Night of Champions helps benefit sick and needy children through the CATCH program, which was initiated in 1987 by former Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson. Specifically, CATCH (Caring Athletes Team for Children’s &amp; Henry Ford Hospitals) raises funds to help pediatric patients at Children’s Hospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Health System. The Academy has been been supporting CATCH since 2000.

Also honored at the event with the Dr. Clarence S. Livingood Humanitarian Award was Dr. Tisa Johnson, a pediatric physician at the Henry Ford Pediatric Group in Detroit.

Last year, Megan Driver and May Savage represented GPA as student emcees at the event, which inducted NFL Hall of Famer and Detroit native Jerome Bettis, Detroit Free Press publisher and president Joyce Jenereaux, and retired Ernst &amp; Young managing partner Al Lucarelli into its hall of fame. Since 1987, 89 men and women have been given the organization’s hall of fame award.

Last week, first through fifth graders from The Grosse Pointe Academy participated in a <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/academy-fun-run-to-benefit-catch-charity/" target="_blank">"CATCH Fun Run"</a></strong> to raise money for the charity. Students were asked to donate $5 and by race time, they had raised a total of $1,074.44 — the largest amount in the school’s history of participation — and presented a ceremonial check to Jim Hughes, executive director for CATCH.

Since 1987, CATCH dollars from special events and donations have facilitated a steady stream of items and services that help improve the quality of life for thousands of needy children.

Specifically, CATCH (Caring Athletes Team for Children’s &amp; Henry Ford Hospitals) raises funds to help sick and needy pediatric patients at Children’s Hospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Health System. The Academy is proud to say it’s been supporting CATCH since 2000.

Erik Brynjolfsson, the author of “The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies,” says there is a disproportionate number of Montessori-educated people founding and managing many of today’s successful tech companies. Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, musician Yo Yo Ma and Wikipedia’s Jimmy Wales, to name a few, he notes.

Brynjolfsson thinks it’s a direct result of the Montessori classroom environment that “emphasizes self-directed learning, hands-on engagement with a wide variety of materials (including plants and animals),” typically occurring in a very deliberate sensorial school day.

Add Wall Street Journal blogger Peter Sims — who says, “the Montessori educational approach might be the surest route to joining the creative elite,” — to the many, many proponents of a education philosophy that is centered in nurturing the uniqueness of each developing child.

Interested parents find out more about these advantages when The Grosse Pointe Academy holds its annual Montessori Information Nights each fall on the Academy’s campus in Grosse Pointe Farms.

During the session, parents observe demonstrations from Academy Early School teachers highlighting the Montessori method's child-centered, individualized approach to education, specifically geared for children 2-1/2 to 5 years old. The event also details the areas of the classroom, learning experiences, and benefits of the Montessori program for those interested in enrolling their children in Michigan’s longest continuously operating Montessori program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Alumna recalls journey from Grosse Pointe Farms to Denver, getting a Super Bowl ring and a meeting with NFL star; says autographed yearbook also might take a starring role in a future Academy auction.</strong>

When 1969 alum Fran (Fitzgerald) Williams was casually thumbing through the most recent edition of “The Academic,” The Grosse Pointe Academy’s biannual magazine for alumni and the school community, one article in particular especially caught her attention.

“I work for the Denver Broncos and could hardly believe my eyes when I saw a picture of a very familiar-looking football uniform mid-magazine,” said Williams, who was a member of the last class of the Academy of the Sacred Heart before the school transitioned to become GPA.

The article she is referring to was about 2005 GPA graduate and Broncos wide receiver Bennie Fowler, who was instrumental in getting his team into the AFC championship game last season. Fowler prepped at Detroit Country Day and played college ball for the Michigan State Spartans after which he signed as a free agent with Denver in 2014. The Broncos beat New England in the AFC championship game last season and went on to become Super Bowl champions by defeating the Carolina Panthers.

Williams works for the Broncos’ Stadium Management Company, LLC (SMC), a subsidiary of the Denver Broncos Football Club. SMC manages all aspects of the team’s Sports Authority Stadium, which is where the Broncos play all of their home games. She said she spends most of her work time at the stadium and unless its a home game, she rarely sees Fowler since the team practices a few miles away.

Earlier this month, with the help of the Broncos’ PR staff, the Academy coordinated a get-together of Williams and Fowler. They met at the team’s training facility (in Dove Valley, Colo.) and exchanged memories of their shared school and campus on Lake Shore Road.

“I really had fun meeting Bennie,” Williams said. “What a nice guy! It was a terrific experience.”

Williams even brought along her ASH yearbook, the last for the school, to Dove Valley so that she and Fowler could compare notes on similarities and changes over 47 years at the school. She also said Fowler graciously autographed the yearbook with his name, number and his GPA graduation year: 2005.

“Someday, that might be a fun auction item for GPA,” noted Williams, whose journey to Colorado began after graduating from ASH, which at that time was operating as a high school.

<strong>Fell in love with a Texan</strong>

“In the fall of 1969, I left home for Boulder to attend the University of Colorado,” Williams recalled. She said her parents had a couple of rules about college that she and her sisters were obligated to observe.

“We had to leave the state of Michigan and we had to graduate in four years,” she said. “I applied to three schools and got accepted to one, thereby making my decision very easy. I was not one of those people who would fall in love with Colorado and then never want to leave, but I did fall in love with a Texan who never wanted to leave. So we got married, and have been here permanently since the spring of 1974.”

Fast forward 28 years to 2002 and after seeing an ad that Invesco Field at Mile High, the stadium where the Broncos play, was interviewing for guest relations staff, Williams thought she’d apply.

“Having been raised as an unwilling football television viewer and then growing into a football enthusiast, and assuming that this would be an easy and profitable means of seeing the games in person, I went for an interview and was hired,” she said. “At the interview, it was made very clear to me that my assumption about seeing the games was completely invalid. That was disappointing, but true!”

Williams nonetheless happily worked full time in guest relations at the stadium until this season. She said that although the average fan probably has no idea what the job actually entails, game days are long, grueling affairs.

“I love the people I worked with and many of the fans became friends, but I decided that once I hit Medicare, I had earned watching the games with my feet up,” she said.

Williams still keeps her feet involved with the stadium, however, but now only as a part-time receptionist.

“I had already been acting in that capacity for about eight years and have a ball doing it,” she said. “I should have kept better notes because the questions and comments that we get cover a gamut you cannot imagine and would make for a very entertaining book!”

<strong>Super Bowl ring</strong>

Williams said that besides football games, the stadium is used year-round for a huge variety of events: weddings, bar/bat mitzvahs, business meetings, proms, and one Democratic Convention assemblage in 2008 when President Obama made his acceptance speech.

“But it was my part-time receptionist job that earned me a trip to Super Bowl 50 in San Francisco and a Super Bowl ring,” she said. “The Broncos really are a wonderful organization.”

Williams notes that her younger sisters, Karen Fitzgerald Hutchinson and Ellen Fitzgerald, also graduated from the University of Colorado and live in Denver. “They attended and graduated from what was then Grosse Pointe University School, now called University-Liggett School, after ASH closed in 1969,” she said.

Even though she’s not working full-time at the stadium any more, Williams does keep its welfare and success uppermost in her mind.

“The stadium where the Broncos play is the same stadium where I applied, but it is now called Sports Authority Field at Mile High,” she said. “That name will change again as the Sports Authority chain of sporting goods stores has declared bankruptcy. Maybe one of your readers would like to explore naming rights at the stadium where the reigning Super Bowl champions compete!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>(Updated: Feb. 9, 2017) In a blog published in 2016 by hipster-friendly hotel company, <a href="https://www.acehotel.com/" target="_blank">Ace Hotel</a>, 2004 Grosse Pointe Academy alum Paige Russell, now living in Austin, Texas, talks about her art and the scarves that take shape from that art as well as one special scarf she made to celebrate Ace’s latest hotel in New Orleans. Enjoy. . .</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26711"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26711" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/4.jpg" alt="4" width="1000" height="750" /></a>

<em><strong>March 25, 2016 (<a href="http://acehotel.com" target="_blank">acehotel.com</a>) — Paige Russell’s Eloi scarves come into the world as construction paper compositions. Unwilling to sentence these creations to a two-dimensional life, Paige transposes her work onto silk, allowing them an infinite number of transcendent new realities — worn around a collar, as a crown or tied tooth-ache around the head of a cayenne-colored hound dog. Paige made the Eloi Le Grande Zombi Scarf for our new home in New Orleans, a celebratory homage to the cultural richness of New Orleans Voodoo and the city itself.</strong></em>

<em><strong>We were lucky enough to catch a minute with Paige to talk about her life and work in Austin, what she’s listening to and how to find inspiration in everyday moments.</strong></em>

<em>Hi Paige. I’ve been thinking about your scarves. I can only imagine what it feels like to make a thing and then have it suddenly exist folded up around someone’s neck. It’s such an intimate place. Suddenly your art is just out in the world, so close to someone. They probably get their perfume on it and the crumbs from their croissant. It’s so different than hanging something in a gallery where it’s just ogled from a distance. What does that feel like?</em>

I think it’s awesome. I love that idea. I’ve always been a person that just wants to surround myself with beautiful objects. That’s just very important to me, to look at pretty things. For someone to choose to bring an object into their life that I made, it’s so cool. You’re right. A scarf is such a classic, utilitarian item. It’s used in so many different ways. It’s an intimate thing, and the fact that people would want to use something everyday with my work on it feels really special.

It doesn’t need to be serious or based in reality at all. It just needs to make people feel something.[/caption]

<em>How does music influence your work? I read somewhere that a lot of your scarves are based on songs.</em>

I listen to a lot of music in my studio, and I’ve always loved music and finding new music. I go on these kicks where I just listen to things over and over and over again, and it somehow informs my work. I don’t realize it until afterwards. And then I think, “Well I have to name it after that song.“ Like, the Miles Davis scarf, I just think it looks like jazz. Yeah, I couldn’t deny it. Most of them I just can’t deny it so I’m like, “Okay. Yeah. That one was given to me by that person or song.” These are the things I’ve been listening to lately.

<em>Talk a little bit about your process and the Le Grande Zombi scarf you made for Ace New Orleans.</em>

With all of my scarves, I begin by making a construction paper cutout piece on wood panel. I layer and layer and layer then photograph the finished product and trace each shape in Illustrator.

My thoughts of New Orleans revolve mostly around celebration (drinking, dancing, parades…) and the eyes and figures were born out of this. The background needed to feel crazy and festive, confetti-ish without looking gaudy.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26712"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26712" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/5.jpg" alt="5" width="1000" height="1010" /></a>

Something wasn’t sticking with the parade thing so I got on a more narrative trajectory. I needed it to feel like New Orleans without getting esoteric. I did some research on Voodoo culture in New Orleans and the symbols used. I went through a few different comps and found the story of “Li Grand Zombi,” the sacred serpent of Nola voodoo culture:

Li Grande Zombi is the major serpent spirit of worship among New Orleans Voodooists. In New Orleans Voodoo, snakes are not seen as symbols of evil as in the story of Adam and Eve. Snakes are considered to be the holders of intuitive knowledge – knowing that which cannot be spoken. Women often dance with serpents to represent the spiritual balance between the genders. Voodoo rituals in New Orleans almost always include a snake dance to celebrate the link to this sacred and ancient knowledge.

<em>Do you feel like you go into a lucid state when you’re working?</em>

Yeah, for sure. I think a lot of the reason why I started doing the cut outs is because it’s super melodic. You can’t do it unless you’re zoned out because it’s just a repetitive motion. I’m working on something right now that’s a four foot by five feet and I’m covering it in these tiny one centimeter dots. I’ve been cutting these for three weeks. It’s driving me nuts but it’s also the most meditative thing that I could do. I think it really eases my anxiety. I have crazy anxiety. Doing this it just so good for me. Like meditation.

<em>Where does the inspiration for the scarves come from? Do you start out with an idea? Are you making a story up? Or do you feel more like you just start cutting and see what happens?</em>

It’s more, I just start cutting and see what happens. I think that a lot of them are inspired by what’s around.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26707"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26707" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/6.jpg" alt="6" width="1000" height="1008" /></a>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26708"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26708" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/7.jpg" alt="7" width="1000" height="1000" /></a>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26709"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26709" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/8.jpg" alt="8" width="1000" height="1000" /></a>Sometimes music, too. It’s kind of just something that’s permeating my head and my space so [the work] just comes out of that. If I’m going through something in my life, it just comes out in that lucid kind of state that we were talking about.

If I go to a museum and see someone’s work and it’s really inspiring to me and then that’s in my head it’s definitely inspired by that. For the Ace New Orleans scarf specifically, it was William Hawkins, the outsider artist. I love his work. I had him in mind the entire time.

<em>How do you get to that lucid place? Do you have a ritual that gets you there? Or is it just a matter of sitting down and being disciplined in the space?</em>

It’s like 75% procrastination and excuses. Then, when I can finally sit down and just zone out, I can get somewhere. I feel like all art or all creation, creating anything, is mostly thought and anxiety and just putting it off. Then you just have to get it out. You just jump off that ledge. It takes a while but once I’m there I just force myself to sit down and start. Then that’s when good things can actually happen.

I always compare it to throwing up. You feel awful and you’re like, “I just want to vomit. I just want to get it over with.” It’s all this build up. Then you do it and it’s like, “Ah. Where was I?” You know? It’s all better.

That’s what my creative process it like at least. It’s like torture.

<em>Yeah, Carl Sagan always said this thing: “In the Universe, nothing is the rule. Something is the exception.” Whole solar systems are created only when something is out of balance in the universe. It’s like art, right? If there is an anxiety or tension there’s a catharsis that comes when a physical thing is made to balance it. I don’t know, kind of a stoney thought. Does making art feel spiritual at all to you?</em>

Yeah. When I make something that I’m very proud of, there’s this fleeting feeling of inner success with a piece that is very spiritual. I set up the piece right in front of my bed so I can wake up and look at it and be proud of myself and then it’s immediately back to the anxiety of having to start over and continue on. It’s very spiritual.

<em>What is your life like in Austin?</em>

I love Austin. The weather’s great. It doesn’t get too cold. I’m kind of a hermit but I have a dog that I’m obsessed with and we go to a bunch of places. We go to all the swimming holes and, you know how Austin is. There’s so many cool nature places throughout the city. It’s like dog heaven. I usually just go places in nature with my dog. Just make work, honestly. I’ve only been here for almost two years, a year and a half. I’m still kind of adjusting to it all. I’ve moved three times in that year and half.

<em>Have you had your dog since she was a puppy?</em>

Yeah. She was actually born on my kitchen floor. It was the worst situation.

I was in Savannah and living with my boyfriend at the time and four other guys and three cats and a pregnant dog. And the dog had ten puppies. Then we had to keep them for the eight weeks. It was a pretty rough. But she was the only girl and I needed her.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/12.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26713"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26713" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/12.jpg" alt="12" width="1000" height="1300" /></a>

<em>Dogs are very powerful. I feel like they’ve evolved psychologically with humans in an emotionally intelligent way. Scientists should be studying this.</em>

Yes! They communicate so well without talking. Dogs are humans.

<em>Dogs are humans. Do you think there are different strengths in different colors? What colors can you not get enough of?</em>

I get really attached to specific pieces of paper. Which is really weird. I have this one that’s a poppy reddish orange and I use it, I think, in every single thing I make. I can’t stop. I tried to. But I love it too much. There are some colors that I can’t really get into. Purple. I don’t know why. I think my mom had something to do with it.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26714"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26714" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13.jpg" alt="13" width="1000" height="1334" /></a>

<em>What other people’s art do you like?</em>

Lately I’ve been really into Rousseau. Lee Krasner, I’ve been looking at a lot of her work lately. She was Jackson Pollock’s wife.

Who else? This guy that went to SCAD, Tim Wirth. His work is so insane. I have one of his paintings. I’m trying to collect more but I’m broke. His work is really inspiring.

<em>What other things inspire you?</em>

I don’t know. Music, I think. Other people’s art. Philosophy. The way other people’s minds work. Psychology is really inspiring to me. I think just pushing that whole surrealist view of what is as opposed to what we know. Flipping that on its head. Which is kind of a psychedelic view too. I’m really into surrealism.

I think when [surrealism] started it was the idea of putting two things together that would not go together in conventional art or ideas or poetry. Putting unlike things together in word play and color play. It appeals to me because I don’t think that everything is as it seems. There’s so much more.

<em>Yeah. Sometimes you can put two things together that have never been next to each other before and somehow that’s more reflective of a true thing.</em>

Exactly. In art nothing needs to be real. It doesn’t need to be serious or based in reality at all. It just needs to make people feel something.

<strong>McMillan Lecture Series event rescheduled after Grosse Pointe Farms power outage.</strong>

The McMillan Lecture originally scheduled for Nov. 7 has been rescheduled for Monday, May 22, 2017.

Officials at The Grosse Pointe Academy in Grosse Pointe Farms were forced to cancel its Nov. 7 William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series event featuring Jessica Lahey due to a utility failure that knocked out power to the school and surrounding area.

Electrical service to GPA, which is located at Moran Road and Lake Shore Road, was interrupted completely beginning around 6 p.m. on Nov. 7 following an accident Monday afternoon at Fisher Road and Grosse Pointe Boulevard that caused power lines to fall in the area.

The rescheduled event with educator, writer and New York Times columnist Lahey will feature among other things the current research on autonomy-supportive parenting and teaching, including Lahey’s take on competence, rewards, praise, and, most importantly, failure, when it comes to raising children.

Lahey, who also is the author of the New York Times bestselling book, “The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed,” is currently on a book tour around the U.S.

More on Lahey, including an exclusive interview, is <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/speaker-announced-for-2016-mcmillan-lecture-at-the-grosse-pointe-academy/" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.

<strong>More on the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series</strong>
William Charles McMillan III was a student at The Grosse Pointe Academy from 1973 until 1981 where, receiving love and encouragement, he learned to reach beyond his limitations. Although weak physically, McMillan was intellectually gifted and his passion for life, his love and concern for all living things, and his enthusiastic use of verbal skills changed the lives of those who were closest to him and left a lasting impression on all with whom he came in contact. Never at a loss for words, McMillan was bursting with impressions, questions and insights which came pouring out in a dazzling, dizzying torrent. It was rare to have a brief, superficial conversation with McMillan. A friend commented, “I sometimes felt like I needed a seat belt when William was talking to me, because he would take us into outer space, back into primeval history, and then into a universe of his own imagining.

"McMillan believed that anyone could make a significant and lasting impact on the world no matter what one’s age, size or circumstance."

The William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series focuses on elementary education and is dedicated to the proposition that every child can reach beyond his or her own limitation, that each child makes the world a better place. It is the goal of these lectures to take your mind where it has never been before.

		<title>Classic Montessori? It makes a difference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Montessori programs can be classified as “classic” or “supplemented.” Find out why The Grosse Pointe Academy offers the classic variation.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0055_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26789"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26789" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0055_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0055_1000px" width="1000" height="864" /></a>

Education pioneer Maria Montessori once declared, “An education capable of saving humanity is no small undertaking; it involves the spiritual development of man, the enhancement of his value as an individual and the preparation of young people to understand the times in which they live.”

Yes, education is a monumental undertaking and Dr. Montessori certainly speaks truth to power. And yes, perhaps it goes without saying that the power to educate begins, most importantly, in the very young.

For children in The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Early School Montessori program, it’s not just the fact that they are receiving the benefit of one of the world’s most innovative method of teaching. Or that it’s being delivered by Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori school. Or even that GPA’s Montessori preschool includes small class sizes and master teachers with consistently updated Montessori certifications.

It’s what happens after Early School that shows the true benefit of a Montessori early education.

A study of creativity published by The British Psychological Society in 2013 (Educational &amp; Child Psychology Vol. 30, No. 2: Maud Besançon, Todd Lubart, Baptiste Barbot) showed that young school-age children who had attended a Montessori program exhibited better creative performance later in their academic careers than children schooled in traditional academic programs.

This was true for all children at all initial creative ability levels for both integrative tasks (drawing and story) and divergent thinking tasks (unusual uses for a cardboard box, improvement of a toy and parallel lines, for example) (Besançon, M., Lubart T., 2008).

But it isn’t just about creativity.

Angeline Lillard, in her book, “Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius,” cited a 2006 study that found that Montessori students leaving kindergarten scored much higher than their peers in public and private schools in standardized math and reading tests.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0018-1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26790"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26790" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0018-1_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0018-1_1000px" width="1000" height="734" /></a>

Susan Gittins, whose son James Raudabaugh, after graduating from GPA in 2012, attended the prestigious International Academy in Troy, Mich., said it was critical that as young student, her son would have the benefit of a school with preschool Montessori as well as can effective transition to its lower through middle schools.

“I did research other schools in the Pointes, but GPA was the only one to meet all my requirements,” Gittins said. “The Academy easily ticked off all my ‘must-have’ boxes, starting with the first one: having a language class in grade one. Number two was having gym/movement/exercise every day. Three was a Montessori early school so James would transition to the classroom environment alongside other children coming from Montessori; four was early music study, and finally, number five, having all of this in a beautiful and welcoming environment.”

<strong>A family affair</strong>

When current Grosse Pointe Academy parent Sandra Cavataio talks about GPA to prospective parents, she often recalls her own experience in seeking an education for her four children.

When she and her husband first moved to southeast Michigan, education for their children was of paramount importance. After all, she holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in industrial engineering from Louisiana Tech University, and husband, Pietro, is a family-practice physician with an office in Chesterfield, Mich.

Cavataio recalls when she just happened to hear about The Grosse Pointe Academy from another parent at a store in metro Detroit and began to ask more questions about the school to her realtor. This led directly to a house in Grosse Pointe Shores and her children enrolled at the Academy.

“I attended private primary and secondary school and my husband attended public schools,” Cavataio said. “But even though the Grosse Pointe public schools had a pretty good reputation, I told him I felt very strongly about private schools and he has come to see the big advantage.”

She also said they kept hearing that GPA had the best early-school program around, which was a definite factor since her family was still quite young when they first moved into the area.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0225-2_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26791"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26791" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0225-2_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0225-2_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="738" /></a>

Fast forward to 2016, Joseph Cavataio, the oldest of the Cavataio children, is in his second year at the University of Michigan after graduating from Cranbrook-Kingswood. Joseph’s brother, Piero, graduated from GPA in 2015 and followed his brother’s footsteps to Cranbrook, and his sister, Gabriela, matriculated to University Liggett’s upper school and will graduate next spring. The youngest Cavataio child, Alessandro, will finish at GPA in the spring of 2017.

Joseph Cavataio said his first year at Cranbrook was relatively easy for him since he was so far ahead academically. “I’ve noticed that many other students from The Grosse Pointe Academy also ended up doing well with some going into leadership positions at Cranbrook, ranging from class president to editor of the school newspaper,” he said.

<strong>Is it “classic?”</strong>

Author Lillard, who is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, said that just as the Cavataios found out, it is extremely important for parents to do plenty of their own homework when researching Montessori schools.

“Thoroughly interrogate the schools’ credentials,” she recommends. “Parents should look at which organizations have certified the school, and where and how the teachers [often called ‘directresses’] were trained. They can also look at whether the school has a complete set of Montessori materials and whether the children are concentrating deeply as they use the materials.”

In an authentic Montessori classroom, she added, parents should expect to see “all children, including the youngest ones, working independently or in small groups by choice, and happily.”

Lillard noted that even within the world of Montessori, there are significant variations in programming at Montessori schools. She said it’s important to differentiate whether a school that calls itself Montessori is a “classic” Montessori school or is it one offering a “supplemented” Montessori program.

Classic Montessori is the rarer form, according to Lillard. In fact, a recent survey of Montessori schools in the United States showed that only 28% of school heads strongly agreed with the statement, “Our school implements [its education program] according to the original vision of Maria Montessori.” (Murray &amp; Peyton, 2009, p. 28). So, as with any alternative educational program, “fidelity” is an important consideration, Lillard said.

Children in classic Montessori programs — as compared with children in supplemented Montessori, which means the program is “supplemented” with more conventional early-school activities, and Conventional programs — show significantly greater school-year gains on outcome measures of executive function, reading, math, vocabulary and social problem-solving, according to Lillard. She said it shows that high-fidelity Montessori implementation is associated with better outcomes than lower-fidelity Montessori programs or conventional programs.

Jennifer Kendall, who is GPA’s assistant head of school for Early School education and admissions, said the Academy’s early childhood/preschool definitely is classic Montessori.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a4748_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26798"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26798" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a4748_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a4748_1000px" width="1000" height="775" /></a>

“As an example, just as Maria Montessori prescribed, children in our Montessori classrooms are introduced to different materials throughout their Montessori years, and each of the materials presented by the teacher has a definite purpose,” Kendall said.

“While both conventional play-based and Montessori classrooms have something resembling block objects in the room, a classic Montessori classroom has the ‘pink tower’ of ten varying shaped block units,” she said. “This tower is a Montessori material that is used to help develop coordination, set a basis for the number system and increase awareness of dimension.”

Another Montessori “prescription” from Dr. Montessori is having children of different ages in the same classroom.

“Maria Montessori believed that younger children would benefit from a classroom community formed with the older children,” Kendall said. “The multi-age classroom allows younger children to learn from the older students and model their behaviors. It also allows the older students a chance to reinforce their own knowledge by helping the younger students.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>GPA art teacher says inspiring students with “design-thinking” leads directly to creative and innovative solutions in class.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26814" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0257_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26814"><img class="wp-image-26814 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0257_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0257_1000px" width="1000" height="972" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy teacher Erin Brott studied art at Detroit's prestigious College for Creative Studies and holds an art education degree from the University of Michigan.[/caption]

(Updated March 12, 2017)

Grosse Pointe Academy art teacher Erin Brott said she’s singularly focused on making sure her students remain excited about what they are learning.

“I encourage all of our students to try and push their own boundaries,” she said. “I try to guide and support them to gain the skills and knowledge it takes to be a confident artist or designer, but more importantly, I also believe it is important to allow them room to make mistakes and urge them to learn through the process.”

Brott, who is in her second year on staff at the Academy, also said motivation remains uppermost in her approach to her art students. She said keeping kids inspired does wonders for keeping them engaged. In fact, it was Brott’s own art teachers who inspired her own path to art and art education.

“I became an art teacher because I was totally inspired by the amazing art teachers that I myself had in school,” Brott said. “I was kind of an average student academically, but when I got to high school, I found my true passion in art. And that pushed me to achieve higher goals.”

She said art propelled her through high school because she was more of a visual learner and that she learned best by seeing and doing.

“Through my interests in art, I was able to excel in all of my other core subjects in school and it really made me think differently about the very real art concepts that also exist in math, science, and yes, language, history and culture,” she said. “The arts also made me more creative when I problem-solve and gave me the confidence to express my ideas in any capacity.”

Brott took the same approach to her first teaching job at Detroit’s Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School, where she taught for three years. She said “design-thinking” was an established process at HFA, where you creatively guided students to solve complex problems to create unique and innovative solutions.

“I really loved working in a solution-focused and action-oriented environment,” she said. “All of the lessons I learned there are ingrained in my philosophy of education and they highly influence my current pedagogy here at GPA.”

Lawrence DeLuca, the Academy’s assistant head of school for instruction and grades 1-8 principal, agrees that Brott definitely is focused on new ways to engage GPA’s student body.

“Everytime I walk down the hallways, I am astounded by the amazing artwork our students produce with Ms. Brott, from kindergarten to grade 8.” he said. “Not only does she inspire our students to create great pieces, but she often incorporates interdisciplinary projects as well.”

DeLuca recalls that recently Brott organized a glass-blowing project where middle school students learned the science behind glass blowing and then created molten glass in the science lab. “Then the students blew the glass and sculpted it in the art loft. It was a very fun and authentic learning experience for the students that they will likely remember for a long time,” he said.

Photos from the glass art project are <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/glass-art-class-at-the-grosse-pointe-academy/" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.

<strong>From CCS to U-M to GPA</strong>

Brott’s undergrad work began for her at the prestigious College for Creative Studies in Detroit where she majored in fine arts with a focus on painting. Immediately after starting at CCS, she developed a real urge to share all of the exciting new concepts she was learning with younger students. She then added art education as her second major.

“As I was learning more and more about education, it quickly became my singular focus,” she said “and so I then transferred to the University of Michigan-Flint and enrolled in their visual arts education program.”

Immediately upon graduation from U-M, she got a job at The Ann Arbor Art Center, a nonprofit arts organization located in downtown Ann Arbor that offers workshops and classes for artists of all ages. This gave her the opportunity to inspire a very diverse group of kids and young adults on a weekly basis.

“Working there gave me a sense of purpose as well as validation that I had in fact chosen the right career path,” she said.

Meanwhile, back at GPA, Brott said her own career goals strongly align with GPA’s mission to nurture, challenge, and inspire each child's potential.

“GPA does an excellent job of allowing students to find their unique and individual strengths and it’s my job to individualize my art curriculum to fit each child’s needs,” said Brott, who is a resident of Ferndale. “I do this by incorporating their individual strengths into each project so they find their own success.”

<strong>Going above and beyond</strong>

Now only about halfway through her second year of teaching at GPA, Brott nonetheless said it’s more than enough time to confirm what she thought of the school and its community when she first visited.

“My first impression of GPA was that the buildings were architecturally beautiful and the people were completely focused on their work with the kids,” she said. “Each day I am excited to come to work and see the countless examples of how our teachers go above and beyond to help students realize their potential and reach their goals. Plus, I am constantly impressed by the genuine love of learning that our students show. It is a true testament to the great history of our school and it also shows how dedicated GPA teachers and staff really are.”

[caption id="attachment_26810" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/brott-italy-edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26810"><img class="wp-image-26810 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/brott-italy-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="brott-italy-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="744" /></a> Brott was in Burano, Italy, this past summer. “Burano is the most colorful place I’ve ever seen,” she said.[/caption]

It appears that Erin Brott has found a home at GPA. But, just as a “for instance,” we wondered what kind of career she might have if it wasn’t teaching.

“If I wasn’t a teacher in the traditional sense, I would probably go back to school to be a licensed art therapist,” she said. “With that kind of job, I would be able to work in a children's hospital to support and help patients get through recovery and rehabilitation with the expressive use of visual arts.”

Jennifer Kendall, GPA’s assistant head of school for Early School education and admissions, said Brott has been a wonderful addition to The Grosse Pointe Academy family. “She is not only a great artist herself, but she allows each child to develop their own artistic talent. It is a pleasure watching the art develop grade after grade. Erin is able to reach all children from kindergarten through grade 8, which is a true gift."[/caption]

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy’s unique approach to science and math education is making a difference for its students.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/math_bd4a2803_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26657"><img class="wp-image-26657 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/math_bd4a2803_1000px.jpg" alt="math_bd4a2803_1000px" width="1000" height="773" /></a>

In late October 2016, the results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) test in science, more commonly called the “nation’s report card,” were released and while there has been some improvement over previous results, the report found that only about a third of fourth and eighth graders in public schools nationwide showed “strong academic performance” in the sciences.

"We still are not at a place as a country where we are preparing the future STEM workforce that we need," Education Secretary John B. King Jr. said after assessing the results. "We think there's significant work still to do, but we are heartened by the progress that we see in these results."

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), first administered in 1969, is the largest continuing and nationally representative assessment of what our nation’s students know and can do in subjects such as mathematics, reading, science and writing. Standard administration practices are implemented to provide a common measure of student achievement.

The NAEP science exam, which was given to 237,300 students in 46 states and U.S. Defense Department schools, tested participants in physical science, life science and earth and space sciences.

Nationally, the test results showed that 38 percent of fourth-grade students were considered proficient or above in science. In eighth grade, 34 percent were proficient or above. The rest were at or below the basic level. In 2011, the last time NAEP tested for science, only 32 percent nationwide performed at or above what is considered proficient.

Michigan's fourth- and eighth-graders ranked in the middle of the pack nationally on the test, which is given to a representative sample of students in each state, according to data released yesterday.

Asked what improvements those states that are below the national average can make to improve science achievement, education secretary King said, "We know some things from research about what makes a difference for long-term success in the STEM fields.”

He said investing in early learning opportunities, “specifically high-quality pre-kindergarten, where young students are exposed to science through play and developmentally appropriate learning experiences has shown to improve outcomes.”

<strong>GPA math and science making a difference</strong>

With all that as background, a general look at private school science and math programming vs. public programming paints a picture with great contrast. In a 2006 comparison made for mathematics in Grade 8 by the U.S. Department of Education, where all private schools in the nation were compared to all public schools, the average private school mean mathematics score was 12.3 points higher than the average public school mean mathematics score.

It is perhaps unfair to compare public school student performance with private and independent school students and it’s not always an apples-to-apples comparison since testing can be wildly divergent. And class size is likely a big factor when looking at public vs. private.

Joseph Cavataio, a 2015 graduate of Cranbrook-Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills and The Grosse Pointe Academy (2011) who now is at the University of Michigan studying engineering, says he’s definitely noticed a difference in fellow students from public vs. private schools. He says in calculus class, for example, when he started at U-M, he was already four college credits ahead of his peers.

Cavataio gives a big shout-out to GPA and to its chemistry class, saying that it definitely prepared him well for high school chemistry—which he says directly led to him placing out of all of his required U-M chemistry classes—even though he only took one honors chemistry class at Cranbrook.

“Also, the Academy definitely prepared me to be a leader,” he said. “Because of the small class sizes at GPA, we had the opportunity to be in the limelight quite often and that gave me the confidence to pursue leadership opportunities in high school.”

He recalled that his freshman year at Cranbrook was relatively easy for him since he was so far ahead academically. “And I noticed that many other students from the Academy also ended up in leadership positions at Cranbrook,” he said.

<strong>STEAM-powered science</strong>

The Grosse Pointe Academy’s fourth- and fifth-grade science program has been designed to engage students in a variety of hands-on experiences through labs and simulations using the scientific method, according to school officials. Cooperation and collaboration are encouraged as students problem-solve in pairs or small groups, which leads generally to higher achievements within the curriculum.

The Academy’s STEAM program also plays a big role in the school’s focus on science.

Didi DiBoer, assistant head of school for grades 4-8 and the Academy's former 4th grade teacher, says Academy students have the rather unique opportunity at a young age to focus on real-world challenges.

“While utilizing an engineering-design process in our STEAM lab and garden classroom settings, students are engaging in science lessons that are completely relevant to them,” she said. And allows them to work collaboratively to solve problems while being immersed in hands-on inquiry. Our STEAM lessons not only integrate science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics, our students are also becoming engaged and open-ended in their discussions, which leads to multiple correct answers and surprisingly creative solutions.”

Another Academy alum, George Spica (’11), who attended Interlochen Arts Academy and is currently pursuing his arts education in London where he attends the Slade School of Fine Art at University College, has a more novel perspective of how the time he spent at GPA gave him a head start.

“I attended GPA from preschool to grade eight and what I now realize is that the tradition and rigor that characterizes a GPA education is in fact what enabled me to engage in more unorthodox means of learning in my high school years,” Spica said. “In other words, I was so comfortable and well-versed in my academics after graduating from the Academy, I was far more open to the idea of alternative-learning methods as I matured in the context of an art school.”

<strong>ERBs at GPA</strong>

Michelle Roberts, who teaches math and science in the Academy’s middle school, says GPA students in general are very well-prepared for high school, including the science courses they take.

“Our alums in local public school chemistry classes say they are doing well and some of our high school freshmen even tell me that they do not really see any new material in class until the spring semester,” Roberts said. “Students from the Academy generally have a much better background in chemistry than their peers who attended school either at another independent school or at a public school.”

For math, especially when it comes to testing, Roberts says it’s hard to compare GPA student performance with other schools.

“We test students in mathematics using the ERBs, which is a tool for us to make sure we are hitting the standards for local, state and national assessments,” she said.

ERB (Educational Records Bureau) testing was designed to provide highly regarded admission assessments for students applying to independent schools and/or specialized public schools that require entrance exams in the United States and in other countries of the world. Academy officials say that since GPA students take the ERB tests, they are at distinct advantage when competing for high school admissions or scholarships to more elite independent schools.

At GPA, students in grades 2-7 take the test and the school receives national norms for grades 4-7. Of those benchmarked results, two thirds of Academy students scored in the 90th percentile or higher on the national norms in at least one subtest of the ERB CTP 4. This means that when looking at GPA students compared with the entire nation, the majority of them rank in the top 10% in at least one academic area.

Roberts said GPA middle-schoolers don’t use ERB for science, however, though some take it in high school, depending on the school they attend.

<strong>Stand-alone middle school vs. K through 8</strong>

Another factor perhaps in the overall success of The Grosse Pointe Academy’s math and science programs can be attributed to the fact that students at GPA are enrolled in a continuum of curriculum that for many begins in early school Montessori.

Roberts, who shares middle school math teaching duties at GPA with Wendy Jerome, Julie Anderson, and Robert Rochte, says by the time Academy students get to their classes, they are very well-prepared. “I think it’s how we integrate the Montessori foundation with traditional methods of math education that provides these kids with the readiness necessary for middle school and beyond,” she said.

[caption id="attachment_26658" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/science_bd4a3056_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26658"><img class="wp-image-26658 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/science_bd4a3056_1000px.jpg" alt="science_bd4a3056_1000px" width="1000" height="884" /></a> Students from the Academy generally have a much better background in chemistry than most of their peers who attended school either at another independent school or at a public school.[/caption]

A number of studies back up this assertion by Roberts. Research has found a significant drop in test scores for students who attend stand-alone middle schools while scores for students in K-through-8 programs tend to stay constant or increase during middle school years.

Over 75 percent of GPA’s 6th-grade students and 65 percent of its 7th-grade students last year ranked in the top 10 percent nationally in math on the ERB CTP4 area tests, qualifying them for the Northwestern University Midwest Academic Talent Search (NUMATS), a gifted and talented identification program.

Roughly 80 percent of Academy graduates take AP and Honors courses in high school vs. 46 percent overall at Grosse Pointe South and 32 percent nationally who take AP courses.

&nbsp;

<strong>Personalized yet methodical and technological</strong>

While students who matriculate through GPA from Montessori early school to middle school benefit from a fully integrated academic program, the math and science curricula at the middle school level has been designed to take students methodically and purposely from one subject to another.

Middle school mathematics, for example, begins in 6th grade with the preparation for more advanced mathematics, such as algebra and geometry, while at the same time reinforcing general arithmetic skills. Mathematical modeling, the use of manipulatives, and real life problems allow students to understand the increasingly abstract concepts presented.

And while algebra per se is not in the 6th-grade math program at GPA, students do study “algebraic reasoning,” pre-algebra and “algebraic thinking.” By 7th grade, students are fully into algebra and then get a very healthy dose of geometry along with more advanced algebra in grade 8.

Middle school math and science teacher Roberts says that as she takes her students through the rigorous academics, it’s not always all about books and no.-2 pencils, though.

“Wendy (Jerome) and I definitely have used technology as another way to improve the math program for our kids,” she said. “We use many computer applications to ‘flip’ the classroom.” Which means that students see lectures and teacher presentations at home or on their own time and then use classroom time to work out problems and get more individualized help.

“We make our own videos for flipped instruction as well as for students who are not in class for some reason,” Roberts said.

<strong>Student-centered</strong>

The idea of individualized help, it appears, also is central to the high performance of Academy students, especially in mathematics. Teachers work directly with students to develop personalized roadmaps for success. Throughout the years at GPA, teachers remain in close contact with parents and families to provide progress updates and to set goals.

The big barn on The Grosse Pointe Academy campus is looking a lot snazzier these days. That’s because it’s received a new coat of bright red paint, thanks to the school’s maintenance staff.

[caption id="attachment_26914" align="alignright" width="240"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/red-barn2_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26914"><img class="wp-image-26914 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/red-barn2_350px-240x300.jpg" alt="red-barn2_350px" width="240" height="300" /></a> Sasha Murphy, GPA's dean of students and physical ed teacher for grades 4-8, gives students a quick history lesson of "the barn."[/caption]

“The project took about two weeks because we had to fit it into our normally very busy schedule,” said Keven Alt, who manages GPA’s maintenance crew.

He said the last time it was painted was approximately 10 to 15 years ago.

Molly McDermott is GPA’s former longtime admissions director and now assists the school’s development office. She recalls that years ago, the facility was painted by different means – and painting crew. “Actually, back in the 70s, school parents helped paint the building whenever it needed a coat.”

“The Barn,” as it is officially called, was built in 1860 and is included in the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

Alt said he believes the building was originally built as a carriage house, and even though it currently just houses all of his groundskeeping equipment, it nonetheless needed a facelift since it’s such a prominent part of the school’s look and feel.

“We just collectively decided — maintenance staff, board members, administration — that we could use some additional color to brighten up the campus,” he said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Nurturing, caring teacher finds a home at a nurturing, caring school.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26928" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a26311-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26928"><img class="wp-image-26928 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a26311-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a26311-edit-crop_1000px" width="1000" height="779" /></a> Lindsey Furgal, a 1st-grade teacher at The Grosse Pointe Academy, says her goal every day of every school year is "to make sure my students feel comfortable and safe in their learning spaces, so that they can strive to be the very best versions of themselves.”[/caption]

The Grosse Pointe Academy’s mission is to nurture, challenge and inspire its students. Head of School Tommy Adams says the Academy prides itself on its warm and nurturing environment “where each child is known and respected.”

For Lindsey Frugal, a 1st-grade teacher in GPA’s lower school, she can’t believe how lucky she was to find a job in such an environment that fits her so well.

“I don’t think I could’ve ever found a more meaningful, rewarding job for myself than the one I have now,” she said. “I think my own nurturing and caring personality has allowed me to create a warm, comfortable and safe learning environment for my students. They always seem happy and excited to come to school every day to learn.”

That’s probably because she loves to make school and learning fun for her students, which is blatantly obvious once you enter her classroom.

“I really try to keep my classroom full of laughs and smiles,” she said. “I can truly say that I have found my gift and passion in life — and that is teaching children.”

Teaching children seemingly has been on Furgal’s radar for a while. She grew up in Grosse Pointe Woods, attended Mason Elementary School, Parcells Middle School and Grosse Pointe North High School, graduating in 2003.

“I’ve always wanted to be a teacher as far back as I can remember,” she said. “Growing up I had some amazing teachers in my life and I thought it would be totally rewarding to be that same kind of leader and mentor for students of my own. I was a babysitter/nanny for children all through high school, and I think I shared a special bond with many kids and families throughout those years.”

So nurturing children was always something she was good at, she thought. But upon entering Michigan State University for college, there was still some uncertainty in what she wanted to pursue and what career direction she wanted to take. In fact, she ended up graduating with a bachelor’s degree in communication (in 2007) and went on to work in marketing and advertising at jobs in the Metro Detroit area and in Chicago for about four years.

<strong>It was inevitable</strong>

However, it was about that time when she couldn’t forestall the inevitable any longer.

At that point in my life, I just didn’t see myself wanting to excel in any other career path,” she said. “It was clear that my heart was with teaching.”

So she moved back home to Grosse Pointe and started school full-time again, this time at Oakland University where she earned a second bachelor’s degree in elementary education, which she completed in December of 2013.

“While at OU, since I already had a bachelor’s from MSU, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach in a wide-variety of public schools while taking classes,” Furgal said. “I gained so much classroom experience while subbing and was able to directly apply what I was learning about in school in an actual classroom setting.”

She completed her student-teaching at Shawnee Elementary in the Chippewa Valley Public School District (in a 2nd-grade classroom). Following her OU graduation, she picked up a two-month, long-term substitute position in another 2nd-grade classroom at that same school, and later completed an additional long-term substitute position at another Chippewa Valley school (in a 1st-grade classroom).

“My growth and experience throughout my elementary education program at Oakland has definitely molded me into the teacher I am today” Furgal said. “I am so grateful for those opportunities and for the guidance I received from numerous mentors and role models along the way.”

Furgal hired on at the Academy in the fall of 2014, which makes this her third year at GPA.

Every day during those two-and-a-half years, she said, she’s reminded of why she chose to switch career paths to become a teacher: “It’s because of the kids.”

And it’s because of the kids that gets her up every school-day morning with a singular focus and goal.

<strong>Celebrating individuality</strong>

“I feel that my number-one job as a teacher is to make sure each one of my students genuinely wants to come to school,” she said. “So my goal every day of every school year is to make sure my students feel comfortable and safe in their learning spaces, so that they can strive to be the very best versions of themselves.”

She also said that because GPA offers such a wide-range of special classes and extracurricular activities, its students have more opportunities than those at most other schools to become well-rounded, cultured and confident students.

“Plus, I strongly believe that all the teachers at GPA do an excellent job of encouraging our students to celebrate their individuality and unique qualities,” she said. “In my case, I feel that my nurturing, supportive and dedicated teaching style inspires my students to learn and grow in a way that best fits them. But across the board, Grosse Pointe Academy teachers make it a priority to provide each and every student with all the support and encouragement they need in order to succeed.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>GPA alumnus in the U.S. Naval Academy wants to make an impact for good.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_26944" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26944"><img class="wp-image-26944 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh1_1000px.jpg" alt="josh1_1000px" width="1000" height="713" /></a> U.S. Naval Academy student and GPA alum Josh Gray ('10), center, is with fellow midshipmen in Annapolis, Maryland.[/caption]

Grosse Pointe Academy graduate Josh Gray spent the better part of yesterday morning on his former school’s campus talking to middle schoolers about the U.S. Navy and the United States Naval Academy.

He knows what he’s talking about because he is well into his own commission at the Naval Academy.

“I expect to finish up at the Naval Academy in 2018,” said Gray, who graduated from GPA in 2010, and was home for a long weekend.

Gray signed on with the USNA in Annapolis, Maryland, after high school at Grosse Pointe South because he thought it was the best way for him to make a real difference in the world.

“I chose to go to the Naval Academy because it was an opportunity to be part of something greater than myself,” he said. “Also, I believe the Naval Academy stands for things I believe in. Plus, it will give me an opportunity to make a tangible impact for good in the world.”

[caption id="attachment_26942" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh3_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26942"><img class="wp-image-26942 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh3_1000px.jpg" alt="josh3_1000px" width="1000" height="1026" /></a> Gray speaks to GPA middle-school students about the U.S. Navy at a special assembly on November 21, 2016.[/caption]

According to the U.S. Naval Academy, even though midshipmen technically are college students, all are still considered on active duty in the U.S. Navy.

Gray said midshipmen typically attend the academy for four years, graduating with bachelor of science degrees with commissions as either ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps. USNA graduates usually go on to serve at least five years in the Navy or Marine Corps.

Gray has a couple of career goals in mind after graduation. “I’d like to serve in the Navy’s special warfare unit or as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps,” he said.

Even though he’s well-focused on serving his country in the future, Gray nonetheless recalled the eight years he served at The Grosse Pointe Academy, which, he said, gave him a real foundation for his own definite expectations for excellence.

[caption id="attachment_26943" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26943"><img class="wp-image-26943 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/josh2_1000px.jpg" alt="josh2_1000px" width="1000" height="1347" /></a> Josh Gray is with his two sisters, Anna, left, who is in the 4th grade, and Kaitlyn, an 8th grader at The Grosse Pointe Academy.[/caption]

“I’ve got many good memories at GPA, especially of the many teachers I had,” he said. “In particular, remember Mr. (Bob) Lapadot's WEN (Write Every Night) assignments in 5th grade. That's when I really learned to enjoy writing and thinking creatively.”

Lawrence DeLuca, GPA’s assistant head of school for instruction and grades 1-8 principal, said Gray’s success so far in his young career doesn’t surprise him.

“Josh was an excellent student and a natural leader,” DeLuca said. “His hard work and strong moral character have served him well, and we are very proud to see him excelling at the Naval Academy.”

[caption id="attachment_26978" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1581_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26978"><img class="wp-image-26978 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_1581_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="img_1581_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="667" /></a> Grace Andreasen, a 2014 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, plays character Nettie in the University Liggett School’s production of “Orphan Train,” which was performed Nov. 3-6. ("Orphan Train" photos by Holland McClinton, ULS)[/caption]

Grace Andreasen recently finished a run as the character Nettie MacCleary in the University Liggett School’s production of “Orphan Train.” The drama tells the riveting story of nine orphans on a train that leaves New York City’s Grand Central Station, circa 1914, and travels west to towns in search of homes, any homes, anywhere for the orphaned and unwanted children. Andreasen’s Nettie is a young Kansas farm wife who suffers a terrible loss of her own baby. It’s a heart-rending story with enough ups and downs to test even the most experienced actor.

“My role in ‘Orphan Train’ was definitely a challenge,” said Andreasen, who graduated from The Grosse Pointe Academy in 2014. “But it was a very enjoyable challenge and one that I truly embraced.”

She said it is definitely more fun and interesting to play a character that is so multifaceted and complex rather than one that is of a single dimension, and though the part of Nettie was emotionally draining, she really loved it because it was a challenge.

“Acting is feeling things truthfully and conveying that truth to an audience and to your scene partners, and that honesty and vulnerability is what I love about acting,” Andreasen said. “It was quite scary to be emotionally vulnerable onstage for a bunch of people to see, but what made it all worthwhile was the beautiful story we were telling and the emotions we felt while telling it.”

It goes without saying that a story like “Orphan Train” demands so much from its actors.

“I got asked a lot about how I could cry so easily onstage, which is kind of a funny question because it's not about ‘crying on command,’ it's about telling the story and immersing oneself into the world of the play and feeling what that character would truthfully be feeling. That's what I think acting is, or at least that's what it is to me: standing on stage and telling the truth!”

Telling the truth on stage is not new for Andreasen, now a junior at ULS. In fact, she’s been performing on stage since her days at GPA — “I performed in all of the productions at GPA, and I greatly enjoyed them” — and she’s been onstage many times at Liggett and beyond even though at first she wasn’t 100% sold on acting.

“I started out freshmen year at ULS not really knowing if I wanted to get into theater that much,” she recalled. “I had always loved going to see shows, but I didn't know if the whole acting thing was for me. I helped out here and there with the drama department at Liggett, but didn't really do much.”

That all changed during her sophomore year, after she tried her hand at acting for the first time at ULS.

[caption id="attachment_26980" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3920-2_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26980"><img class="wp-image-26980 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3920-2_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="img_3920-2_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="667" /></a> The 2014 GPA alum said that the honesty and sheer vulnerability is what she loves about acting.[/caption]

“I auditioned for a fall show and got a significant supporting role as Elaine in ‘Arsenic and Old Lace.’ I had an absolutely wonderful time over the course of rehearsing and performing that show and learned so much. We actually ended up taking that show to the State Thespian Festival at Saginaw Valley State University and got to perform for a significantly large audience filled with people who really appreciated theater. It was truly an amazing experience!”

That, she said, was the moment when she realized that she wanted to be involved with theater for the rest of her life, including pursuing it professionally. After “Old Lace,” she performed as Amanda in Liggett’s production of Tennessee Williams' “The Glass Menagerie” in the spring.

“That was a taxing role to say the least,” she said. “Then this year, as Nettie in Orphan Train (by playwright Dennis North), it was even more challenging.”

In addition to her acting roles, Andreasen is the director of operations for the University Liggett Players organization, which means that she assists the school’s director in running the theater program and making sure that everything runs smoothly. In addition to this, she was named one of only 12 state thespian officers in Michigan.

Whew! Lots to do for a high school junior in addition to a rather rigorous academic schedule, which, she said, has not been as challenging as it could have been had she not attended the Academy.

[caption id="attachment_26981" align="alignright" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grace_school-pic_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26981"><img class="wp-image-26981 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grace_school-pic_250px.jpg" alt="grace_school-pic_250px" width="250" height="250" /></a> Andreasen said NYU is on her radar for college.[/caption]

“I felt so prepared coming from GPA to Liggett in terms of my ability to manage my workload and also my ability to thoughtfully contribute to class discussions,” she said. “I remember during freshmen year at Liggett that a lot of students (non-GPA kids) were complaining about the amount of homework, and that all of the GPA grads could easily handle it. Also, all of the GPA students seemed in a way more thoughtful and even more mature, and could easily hold meaningful discussions in class.”

Andreasen also had high praise for the GPA faculty.

“In terms of teachers, I really loved all of my teachers at GPA; they were the best,” she said. “In fact, Mrs. (Barbara) Karle and Mrs. (Michelle) Roberts came to see me in ‘Orphan Train’ and I cannot even express how happy it made me to see them and to know that they were supporting me.”

As far as college plans, Andreasen has not arrived at a final choice, although NYU is high on her list.

“I’ve been thinking about college a lot lately and I've been doing some research, but I'm still not completely sure because there are so many choices and factors that go into it,” she said. “However, in a perfect world, I would go to NYU because that has been my dream school for a while now. I'm very interested in the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU and would like to pursue acting and possibly playwriting there.”

It’s not a pie-in-the-sky pursuit for Andreasen even though she knows that theater as a career might be a risky choice. She has no illusions, but also offers a bit of advice. . .

“It will take a lot of hard work; however, it's what I love and am passionate about. And if I could give other students any piece of advice, it would be to follow and pursue your passion because doing what you love and what makes you happy is extremely important.”

(Updated 02/03/17)

“To nurture” is perhaps the most commonly referenced component of The Grosse Pointe Academy’s triumvirate of a mission statement. Along with “to challenge” and “to inspire,” the Academy’s unique quality of nurturing the potential of each child and allowing its students to discover their unique strengths in a caring and comforting environment is what many parents cite when talking about their children’s education at GPA, especially those with very young students at the school.

But while a nurturing environment is a critical foundation for 2-1/2-year old to kindergarten-age children in GPA’s Montessori Early School, it nonetheless also proves to be just as important for students facing the transition to high school.

Middle school is a notoriously difficult time for students, as it serves as the transition from the usually well-structured elementary grades to a more independent and demanding high school. Whether it’s ensuring they feel safe and cared-for in the classroom, or keeping tabs on the wavering assessment of their own abilities to compete and succeed, or maybe just staying out of the way of the many swirling and raging hormones, teaching pre-teen students is usually a pretty tough row to hoe.

In fact, it’s been said that those who teach middle school are most likely to take up bungee-jumping as a way to relax after their work day ends.

One Stanford University professor took on the middle-school “mindset” recently in order to better define some of these issues, especially as it relates to a student’s confidence in his or her own ability to learn and grow.

In research led by Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford, the difference between a “fixed” and a “growth” mindset in school-aged children, specifically children in middle school, was examined.

Dweck defined a fixed mindset basically as a belief by a student that intelligence is nearly always innate. In other words, either you’re born with smarts and the ability to achieve great things — or you’re not.

A growth mindset, according to Dweck after surveying 373 middle-school students, means that the student believes that achievement is variable and that problem-solving ability is something to be developed over time.

[caption id="attachment_27026" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a3100_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27026"><img class="wp-image-27026 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a3100_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a3100_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="709" /></a> A Stanford University study concluded that to nurture a growth mindset in students, it’s important to encourage them by specifically praising their efforts to solve problems themselves.[/caption]

Dweck said that kids with a fixed mindset were more likely to be bored in school because they were less apt to try new things or new ways to solve problems. If they weren’t getting it, it probably was the teacher or the school’s fault — or they think they just don’t “have it.” Growth-minded students, on the other hand, looked at school work as a series of puzzles and challenges to tackle, which made them less likely to complain that any external factor was causing their difficulties.

Dweck concludes that to nurture a growth mindset, it’s important to encourage students by praising their “efforts” to solve problems rather than focusing on praise for “how smart” they are.

For The Grosse Pointe Academy, in addition to academic excellence, shaping young people and preparing them for life’s challenges is one of the school's strengths. Acknowledging achievements is important, but setting goals and creating leadership opportunities is essential to building student confidence, according to school officials. This enables them to set and achieve their own goals — and become more growth-minded students versus fixed.

Lawrence DeLuca, GPA’s assistant head of school for instruction and principal of grades 1-8, said it comes down to individual attention.

“Small class sizes at the Academy give teachers the opportunity to know their students on a much more personal level and to better recognize and encourage more individual growth,” DeLuca said.

“Research shows that K-8 schools of fewer than 400 students are the best social environments for middle school children,” he added. “The Grosse Pointe Academy middle school program provides an academic, artistic, spiritual, physical, and social environment that promotes the education of the whole child.”

He said that because of small classes, middle school students at GPA have daily access to an advisor, which means they are more easily creating bonds not only with fellow students but with an engaging and caring faculty and staff that nurtures and advocates for students in and out of the classroom.

“We also provide high school counseling that offers individualized assistance in placing students in over a dozen of the top high schools in our area to ensure our students and families find the right high school fit,” he said.

DeLuca noted that while studies have found a significant drop in test scores for students who attend stand-alone middle schools, scores for students in K-8 programs similar to the one at the Academy tend to stay constant or increase during middle school years.

The proof is in the pudding.

“Roughly 70% of our students in grades five through eight rank in the top 10% nationally on the ERB CTP4 area tests and qualify for NUMATS,” DeLuca said. NUMATS, or Northwestern University Midwest Academic Talent Search (NUMATS), is a gifted- and talented-student identification program.

He said that not only does GPA provide a rigorous academic program that prepares middle schoolers according to their abilities and interests, the school’s welcoming and encouraging environment makes them comfortable enough to participate in high school classes, some even while still at GPA.

“Plus, after graduating from GPA, roughly 80% of our graduates take AP and Honors courses in high school,” he said. “That is versus 46% at Grosse Pointe South and 32% of students nationally who take AP courses.”

For Grosse Pointe Academy's Amal El-Hosni, who teaches world language in the middle school, she’s also a big believer in the nurturing part of the school’s central mission as it applies to middle-schoolers, and how it helps to shape them in both academics and life.

“I make sure my students always know they are in a safe environment, and that it’s okay to fall and make mistakes, as long as they are willing to get up and try again,” she said. "Some students might be afraid or reticent with such an approach, but in the end they usually rise up to the challenge and realize why I was pushing them. After all, this school is all about nurturing potential, and allowing students to discover their own strengths.”

One hundred and three years this past December, Dr. Maria Montessori first traveled to the United States on a three-week lecture tour that included films of her European classrooms and a number of assemblies. Everywhere she went in America, she was met by large, enthusiastic crowds, even though at that time only about 100 Montessori schools had been established in the country.

Today, there are more than 4,500 Montessori schools in the United States and about 20,000 worldwide.

The Grosse Pointe Academy, which is home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program, is pleased to offer four quotes from Maria Montessori, founder of the Montessori method, arguably the world’s most innovative education philosophy. Enjoy!

"The child has a different relation to his environment from ours... the child absorbs it. The things he sees are not just remembered; they form part of his soul. He incarnates in himself all in the world about him that his eyes see and his ears hear." <strong>(from The Absorbent Mind, first published 1949)</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27040" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a0220-1_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27040"><img class="wp-image-27040 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a0220-1_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0220-1_1000px" width="1000" height="711" /></a> The Grosse Pointe Academy is home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program.[/caption]

"A three-year-old educated according to Montessori pedagogy, becomes a master of his hand and undertakes with a joy a variety of human activities. These activities allow him to develop the power of concentration." <strong>(from the San Remo Lectures, released in 1949)</strong>

“Under the urge of nature and according to the laws of development, though not understood by the adult, the child is obliged to be serious about two fundamental things … the first is the love of activity… The second fundamental thing is independence.” <strong>(from What You Should Know About Your Child, first published in 1948)</strong>

"The child's development follows a path of successive stages of independence, and our knowledge of this must guide us in our behavior towards him. We have to help the child to act, will and think for himself. This is the art of serving the spirit, an art which can be practiced to perfection only when working among children." <strong>(from The Absorbent Mind)</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Nineteenth-century facility proves to be popular venue for today’s soon-to-be marrieds. </strong>

[caption id="attachment_27067" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-wedding_party2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27067"><img class="wp-image-27067 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-wedding_party2_1000px.jpg" alt="tomtasha-wedding_party2_1000px" width="1000" height="692" /></a> Tasha and Tom Weiss were married in The Grosse Pointe Academy’s historic chapel.[/caption]

When first walking into The Grosse Pointe Academy chapel on Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Farms, you are struck by the beautiful wood carvings of Mary and St. Joseph on either side of the main altar. The artwork frames one of southeast Michigan’s most outstanding and literal examples of French Gothic architecture.

Originally designed by noted liturgical architect Harry J. Rill and constructed in 1899 at the behest of the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Academy chapel serves as a much more accessible version of the famed Sainte Chapelle located in Paris, France.

[caption id="attachment_27059" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27059"><img class="wp-image-27059 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-300px.jpg" alt="tomtasha-300px" width="300" height="448" /></a> Designed by architect Harry J. Rill and constructed in 1899 at the behest of the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Academy chapel serves as a more accessible version of the famed Sainte Chapelle located in Paris, France.[/caption]

The walls of the Academy chapel are buff-colored with a high vault of blue and gold even more reminiscent of Sainte Chapelle. Above the sanctuary, a fleur-de-lis motif is stenciled in gold leaf against a blue background with stalls and benches artistically carved in front of the choir loft, which houses a beautiful German pipe organ built in Quebec.

Among its most striking features are the twelve large stained-glass windows, created in Munich, Germany, that depict scenes from the life of Christ. The corners of several of these windows were originally designed to open up into the second floor of the school so that the older nuns in the adjoining convent could attend mass without leaving their quarters.

Inside, at the front of the chapel stands a white marble altar with a pinnacle housing the tabernacle. In front of that white marble altar has stood many a young couple who have professed their wedding vows. In fact, it seems that more and more young couples are choosing The Grosse Pointe Academy chapel to host their wedding ceremonies.

“The last several years we've averaged about 62 weddings a year,” said Sue Martin, assistant to the head of school and external events coordinator at the Academy. “About 54 of them are Catholic chapel weddings and eight to 10 are outdoor ceremonies on our lawn facing Lake St. Clair.”

<strong><em>Please contact Sue Martin at 313-886-1221 x120 or <a href="mailto:smartin@gpacademy.org" target="_blank">smartin@gpacademy.org</a> to schedule an appointment to tour and see for yourself what an ideal setting The Grosse Pointe Academy can make for your special day.</em></strong>

Research shows that while today more than 25% of weddings are destination weddings, many more couples preferring to stay closer to home.

[caption id="attachment_27058" align="alignright" width="400"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-400px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27058"><img class="wp-image-27058 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tomTasha-400px.jpg" alt="tomtasha-400px" width="400" height="569" /></a> Tasha and Tom Weiss said they had nothing but positive things to say about their experience at the Academy chapel.[/caption]

When Tasha and Tom Weiss began to scout venues for their upcoming wedding a few years ago, in their minds, they kept coming back to the Academy chapel.

“Living near the chapel on the east side, we both drove by it often,” said Tasha, who grew up in the Pointes and now lives and works in Chicago with husband Tom. “We looked at probably four or five different venues for our reception, but we both decided we were going to look into the Academy chapel first for our ceremony, which was going to be a Catholic ceremony. We really liked it and were both very happy with the way it looked. So that was it. We did not look for any other options.”

<strong>Architecture wows</strong>

Even though Tasha and Tom likely did not know a lot about the history or architectural significance of the chapel they were about to get married in, they certainly knew it had much of the former and even more of the latter.

Below its white marble altar, a movable wooden altar faces out toward those who assemble at the chapel. On the wooden altar are carved three symbols with each representing one aspect of the life of Blessed St. Rose Philippine Duchesne of the Religious of the Sacred Heart who was sent as a pioneer missionary to North America from France in 1818.

“The carving of the ship ‘Rebecca’ represents her arduous journey across the Atlantic,” Martin said, “and the lamp represents the light of faith and prayer. The log cabin carving represents early pioneer hardships in New Orleans and St. Louis.”

Martin also said the small side altar to the left of the statue of the Blessed Virgin is dedicated to St. Madeleine Sophie Barat, the French woman who founded the Society of the Sacred Heart in France in 1800.

Surrounded by children on the carving, Martin said that St. Madeleine is depicted in a striking wood bas-relief. She said most who first walk in the chapel are really struck by the beautiful stained-glass windows, which were actually donated by a number of generous benefactors beginning in 1906.

The Academy chapel saw its first major renovation in 1929, which through the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Walter O. Briggs, also had its footprint expanded so that it connects with the Tudor-Gothic styled school building. The chapel entrance is made of Pewabic tile and there is a bride’s room for members of the bridal party on the second floor next to the choir loft. Martin said the facility, which has a capacity of 190, also recently retooled its sound system that now provides excellent acoustics for whatever a wedding today has in store in terms of music.

<strong>‘Everything went as planned’</strong>

“I feel we really have a strong selling proposition at our chapel because many younger couples no longer are members of a Catholic parish in the area but still want to be married in a Catholic church,” said Martin. “Because we are a school and not a parish, we do not have some of the rules often found at most Catholic parishes in the area.”

“We chose the chapel partly because some of our family were married there and we thought it was beautiful and special,” Tasha Weiss said. “Also, we both grew up relatively close to it and liked its proximity to the water as well as its charm. Plus, it was large enough to fit our friends and family, but not too large that it didn't feel intimate.”

She also noted that the Academy staff was very welcoming and helpful.

“They worked hard to make everything run smoothly for us,” she said. “Everything went as planned. Our ceremony itself was only 20-25 minutes, so it kind of felt like a blur. Plus, after the ceremony, the sanctuary was great for pictures along with the amazing architectural details throughout the rest of the chapel. On top of all that, the scenery outside was the perfect backdrop for many of our wedding pictures.”

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/prepared-for-high-school-college-a-business-and-stressed-out-brides/" target="_blank">Carrie Gentry</a>, a GPA alum who works as a wedding planner, also has high praise for the Academy chapel.

“I love helping couples have a stress-free wedding day and making their dream designs a reality all while staying in their budget,” said Gentry, who’s helped a number of other alums plan their weddings at her alma mater’s chapel.

“Seeing happy couples on their special day never gets old,“ Gentry said.

Today, when it’s not hosting weddings, the chapel remains a peaceful and beautiful space for life at The Grosse Pointe Academy. Students gather every Monday for services in the facility and it also provides a setting where alumni, friends and others from the community come to share chapel services, school events, and other ceremonies. In addition, each year the Academy’s eighth-grade baccalaureate is held in the chapel, typically on a weekday evening in early June.

“But working with couples who are looking for a location to get married is the most rewarding,” said GPA event director Martin. “They are excited to plan, and when we get to see those plans come together, especially when it’s because of our help, it’s a real pleasure and rewarding to be able to accommodate their situations or wishes!

“I love that we can share this breathtaking location with couples on their special day,” Martin said. “It is a beautiful location with history, charm and we think wonderful memories are made here!”

<strong>More on the history of The Grosse Pointe Academy</strong>
The Grosse Pointe Academy is located on a 20-acre campus overlooking Lake St. Clair. It was originally founded in 1885 by the Religious of the Sacred Heart as a boarding and day school for young ladies. In 1969, it became an independent, co-educational day school (Montessori preschool through grade 8). In 1978, the Academy was designated an historical educational complex by the Michigan Historical Commission. In 1985, six Academy buildings, including the chapel, were designated as national historic sites and listed on the Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

[caption id="attachment_27093" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ES_Chapel_Giving_crop1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27092"><img class="wp-image-27093 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ES_Chapel_Giving_crop1000px.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="682" /></a> Chapel Giving: Early School students are gathered in the Academy chapel in front of the many gifts and goods collected for metro Detroit’s less fortunate.[/caption]

Community service is woven into the fabric of everyday life at The Grosse Pointe Academy. Whether the experience takes place as part of the school curriculum or as an individual service project, students not only gain leadership skills that last a lifetime, they learn of the importance of service to the community.

The month of December, in particular, is filled with opportunities for students to learn about the gift of giving through an initiative called Chapel Giving. Early and Lower School students fill baskets with mittens and hats; middle school students and faculty and staff adopt a family, donating toys, clothing and food to share the spirit of the holidays.

[caption id="attachment_27090" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chapel_Giving_Tommy_reading_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27090"><img class="wp-image-27090 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Chapel_Giving_Tommy_reading_1000px.jpg" alt="chapel_giving_tommy_reading_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a> Head of School Tommy Adams reads Luke 2:1–20 (The Birth of Jesus) Wednesday at Chapel Giving.[/caption]

Families of GPA students also contribute with donations of canned goods, toiletries and other supplies for those less fortunate.

Renee Martin, a learning specialist who leads the Academy’s Christian Life program, said the gifts collected this week went to the Capuchin Soup Kitchen in Detroit.

“The drivers from Capuchin arrived to pick up the items soon after the service ended on Wednesday, and one of the drivers was truly taken aback at the amount of food, baby items, and toiletries,” Martin said. “He couldn’t believe that it was all for them to take. He said that it was their biggest pick-up yet. As I talked with students throughout the day about the emotion that this gentleman displayed, we realized that giving is something that we at the Academy just do so graciously. We have this service every year, but seeing the effect that our generosity has is a true blessing. We are truly making a difference in the lives of people who appreciate our kindness.”

This annual Christmas tradition allows the entire GPA community, from the three-year-olds to eighth graders, to gather in the school’s chapel to celebrate the holidays and, more importantly, give back to communities in real need.

“This week, to prepare for the holidays, students in Early School through grade 8 gathered together with faculty, staff and friends of the Academy to give to others, pray together, and share music with one another,” said Jennifer Kendall, the Academy’s assistant head of school for Early School education and admissions. “Chapel Giving is a beautiful tradition at The Grosse Pointe Academy and an opportunity for our children to give to those in need. To top it all off, Melissa Gray, a current and alum parent at GPA, sang a beautiful version of 'O Holy Night' for us in the chapel (video below), which put everyone in the true Christmas spirit.”

		<title>2016: The Academy’s year in the news</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>As we move into 2017, we revisit the past 12 months and highlight The Grosse Pointe Academy’s most-read and noteworthy news stories published on its website.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a1903-edit_crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27189"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27189" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bd4a1903-edit_crop_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a1903-edit_crop_1000px" width="1000" height="943" /></a>

In another fulfilling year at the Academy, news articles about student and alumni achievement dominated as website visitors viewed stories about accomplishments and accolades reached in the classroom, the art room, a stage or in the world at large.

Among the most popular articles in 2016 were stories about alum identical twins who said the Academy prepared them well for the rigors of high school and college; a hockey hall of famer who said at the Academy you were always taught to treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself; a grad who is making a career on screen and stage; an eighth grader who won the WXYZ-Scripps Spelling Bee; a Wellesley grad discussing GPA’s ‘wealth of academic and social learning experiences;’ a nurturing, caring teacher who finds a home at a nurturing, caring school; and an art teacher who said inspiring students with “design-thinking” leads directly to creative and innovative solutions in class.

But one story out of the more than 120 posted in 2016 seemed to gather more views than most. Tommy Adams, on the eve of taking over as head of school at the Academy, eloquently laid out his vision for the school in a wide-ranging June interview that touched on growing up in Long Island, his extensive professional experience, and his goal of continuing to build a school whose graduates are “well-prepared to meet head on the challenges of an ever-changing world."

The following, in reverse chronological order, are some of the most-read Academy highlights for calendar-year 2016.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Alumna says her education at GPA, which started for her as a 3-year-old, was instrumental in high school success and her college choice. She shares hall of fame honor with three Academy classmates.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Leonie-Leslie_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27213"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27213" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Leonie-Leslie_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="leonie-leslie_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="1178" /></a>

Léonie Leslie began her educational journey as a 3-year-old in The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Early School Montessori program and graduated as an 8th-grader in 2012. She experienced another milestone in her academic career when she graduated from Grosse Pointe South High School last year in the Class of 2016 as a member of the GPSHS Academic Hall of Fame, an honor she shares with three other 2012 Academy alums: J.D. Gray, Abigail Kuplicki, and Lily Patterson.

Among the requirements to qualify for South’s Academic Hall of Fame, the school’s highest academic category, students must graduate with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 or above.

Since then, Leslie has enrolled in Michigan State University’s Lyman Briggs College, an undergraduate, residential college founded in 1967 in an effort to bridge the widening gap between sciences and humanities. It is a limited-enrollment program, welcoming only 625 freshmen each fall.

Actually, Leslie, who is the daughter of Academy teacher Claudia Leslie, may be the examplar of MSU’s Briggs College because she is working toward two majors: human biology and German.

“I am also planning on applying to medical schools after completing my undergraduate studies,“ she said.

Leslie’s overwhelming academic career success likely was boosted from her time at the Academy, a notion to which she definitely subscribes.

“I received many benefits from attending GPA,” Leslie said. “The well-rounded education at the Academy has given me the opportunity to be successful in various subjects. But besides its excellent academic program, I was well-prepared for the future because of the skills I learned in GPA classes such as art class, the music classes, creative movement, P.E., Christian Life, computer and library classes, all of which has allowed me to find my passion both inside and beyond academics.”

<strong>MORE ON THE ACADEMY'S PROGRAM IS <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/ourprogram/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</strong>

Another benefit she received from the Academy, according to Leslie, was its foreign language program, specifically French, which for her began at an early age.

“I started learning French when I was three years old in the Early School and continued learning French throughout my years at GPA,” she said. “I continued my French studies at Grosse Pointe South and my exposure to the French language and culture throughout my years at GPA and South allowed me to test into upper-level French classes at both Grosse Pointe South and MSU.”

She says she’s also been able to utilize her foreign language skills during some time recently working abroad and hopes to use them again in the near future when she also plans to study abroad.

Congratulations, Léonie (and J.D., Abigail and Lily)!

<strong>With the <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/art-and-academic-powered-open-house-is-march-8/" target="_blank">2017 Open House and Art Show s</a>cheduled for tomorrow, March 15, it is perhaps a great time to highlight what many parents (and the head of school) say about The Grosse Pointe Academy.</strong>

Tommy Adams, The Grosse Pointe Academy’s head of school, said he is proud of the fact that GPA is providing such a warm and nurturing environment where each student is known, respected and cherished.

He also says that the school’s overall educational program is key to its students developing the skills necessary to become resourceful and creative learners. “Integral to our ‘whole child’ approach to education is our emphasis on character development through leadership and community service opportunities,” Adams said. “We understand the sacred trust parents place in us, so our goal is to continuously encourage lifelong learning with an emphasis on the moral and spiritual development as well as good citizenship in all our students.”

But don’t just take Adams’ word for it. Find out what a number of <strong>current and alum parents</strong> are saying about the Academy. . .

<hr />

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gittins_300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27280"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-27280" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gittins_300px.jpg" alt="gittins_300px" width="300" height="194" /></a>“I did research other schools in the Pointes, but GPA was the only one to meet all my requirements. The Academy easily ticked off all my ‘must-have’ boxes, starting with the first one: having a language class in grade one. Number two was having gym/movement/exercise every day. Three was a Montessori early school so James would transition to the classroom environment alongside other children coming from Montessori; four was early music study, and finally, number five, having all of this in a beautiful and welcoming environment.

“My philosophy always has been to invest in the early years of education and then see the ROI in the high school years. By the time kids get to high school, habits usually are already formed, including good and bad ones. I was comfortable sending my child to a public school for high school as I was confident the foundation had already been laid at GPA. It was worth every penny.”

<strong>Susan Gittins, </strong>mother of James Raudabaugh (GPA Class of 2012)

<hr />

“We were impressed with the school when our kids first started here. But since then we’ve really discovered what the true value of a Grosse Pointe Academy education is.

“It boils down to knowing that your children are getting the right foundation to prepare them for what the world has to offer. That’s it in a nutshell. We landed at the Academy to give our children the right supportive environment for them to take risks, push harder and try new things. We wanted to give them this chance before high school when it may not be as easy to do so.”

“We are extremely confident that The Grosse Pointe Academy—with its nurturing environment, its great teachers, curriculum, culture and resources—is preparing them to achieve their fullest potential.

“While a school can’t eliminate every sleepless night as a parent, the right choice can offer a peace of mind in your children’s education.

“We truly believe we have given Alex and Jack the opportunity to go further in their young lives than we thought was possible. We know that when they leave the Academy, they will take with them the academics and life skills necessary to succeed in high school and then ultimately to thrive in a world that gets more complicated every day.”

<strong>Pam and Fred Rollins, </strong>parents of Alexandra (7th) and Jack (5th)

<hr />

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cavataios2edit-crop2_1000px_feat-820x400.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27749"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-27749" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cavataios2edit-crop2_1000px_feat-820x400-300x146.jpg" alt="cavataios2edit-crop2_1000px_feat-820x400" width="300" height="146" /></a>“I usually tell people that the regular classes at GPA are just like honors classes at the public school. I also talk to them about being so impressed with the Christian values instilled in the children and that the students are very confident and present themselves very well because of all of the many opportunities to shine.

“In addition, languages are very strong at GPA and many of the students there end up in level-3 languages during their high school freshman year.

“The faculty always has been very dedicated and they go well out of their way to help the children. And because of that, I believe, the kids end up excelling in high school and beyond.”

<strong>Sandra Cavataio</strong>, mother of Joseph (GPA Class of 2011), Gabriela (GPA Class of 2013), Piero (GPA Class of 2015) and Alessandro (8th)

<hr />

“Three months into his first school year, Ryan was reciting all the continents, writing and sounding all the letters of the alphabet, successfully learning numbers, including adding and subtracting and knew all his complex shapes, just to name a few amazing accomplishments. Additionally, the interaction these Montessori children at GPA display is astounding at such a young age. They assist each other, teach each other and they empathize with each other.

“I have no doubt my daughters Elizabeth and Margot, also in the Early School, will continue to excel as Ryan has. “There truly is no place like it,” she said. And the Montessori education is phenomenal.”

<strong>Kristine (Armaly) Shalla, </strong>mother of Ryan (5Y), Margot (3D) and Elizabeth (3Y<strong>)</strong>

<hr />

“The Academy is a school where children ‘learn to earn’ not because they feel entitled to win, or get a good grade or to just show up. This is a school where life skills are complemented, academic rigor propels you, strong character leads you, and dedicated teachers educate you way beyond mediocrity.

“The Grosse Pointe Academy is both a sacrifice and an investment. And I don’t know of any greater return on investment than having your child in a private-school environment like GPA that is so nurturing, challenging, inspiring and that includes a real sense of safety and security.

“I just wish there was a GPA high school!”

<strong>Latrelle Williams, </strong>mother of Caleb (GPA Class of 2013), and Kelsey (7th)

“One of the things I will discuss for those attending on Jan. 31 will be a perspective on what I’ve observed and learned during my first six months as the Academy’s new head of school,” Adams said. “I also will talk about the effects of the current educational landscape on independent schools, and the plan to implement changes that will help improve the quality of the learning experience for our students and better position the Academy in the market.”

During tonight’s presentation, which is being called, “Preparing A New Generation of Learners at The Grosse Pointe Academy,” Adams said he also will introduce the workings of a new vision for GPA.

“There will be specific and concrete examples of programmatic change and revision to help enhance the learning and teaching that take place in the classroom at the Academy,” Adams said. “I believe that those attending this event definitely will want to hear about these changes and how it will positively impact their children’s experience at GPA. I look forward to seeing our many parents there.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Grosse Pointe Academy seventh graders supplement ancient Indian history classwork with a visit to a Hindu temple.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27313" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hindu_IMG_6489_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27313"><img class="wp-image-27313 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hindu_IMG_6489_1000px.jpg" alt="hindu_img_6489_1000px" width="1000" height="1333" /></a> Narayana Swamy, of the Bharatiya Temple, speaks to 7th graders from The Grosse Pointe Academy inside its Troy, Mich., facility.[/caption]

The primary philosophy of the social studies department at The Grosse Pointe Academy is for each student to understand the importance of studying the past as well as other cultures. By doing so, students develop an ability to make informed, reasoned decisions in a culturally diverse, democratic society.

With yet another initiative to help bring this philosophy into reality for Academy students, teachers Trevor Clor and Renee Martin spent the day on Wednesday, January 25, with 7th graders at the Bharatiya Hindu Temple in Troy.

According to Clor, the students are in the middle of studying ancient Indian history and culture in social studies class as well as Hinduism as part of their Christian Life class, so the field trip made perfect sense.

“I adamantly believe that students learn best by seeing and doing,” said Clor, who teaches social studies in the Academy’s middle school. Getting out in the community is extremely important to me.”

[caption id="attachment_27316" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hindu_IMG_6510_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27316"><img class="wp-image-27316 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/hindu_IMG_6510_1000px.jpg" alt="hindu_img_6510_1000px" width="1000" height="626" /></a> A number of GPA students are shown in traditional Indian costumes at the temple.[/caption]

Located on Adams Road, in Troy, the Bharatiya Temple was established and opened in 1981 to promote Indian philosophy, religion and a Hindu way of life in the metropolitan Detroit area. The deities at the temple include Ganesh, Lakshmi Narayan, Durga Mata, Radha Krishna, Balaji, Shiva, Parvati, Rama, Sita, Lakshman, Ayyappa and Hanuman.

GPA students toured the temple, witnessed Hindu ceremonies, were taught several Indian dances and were treated to a traditional Indian lunch.

Clor said he really looks forward to these types of field trips.

“It looks like the 8th grade will be heading to the Charles Wright Museum of African American history in the spring and I'm trying to add an underground railroad tour of Detroit along with that,” he said. “It will line up with our Civil War studies. Our 6th graders will head to the Detroit Institute of Arts also in the spring where we’ll look at artwork from ancient Western Hemisphere civilizations to help wrap up our studies for the year.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Portrait of an Academy graduate and upcoming program changes highlight head of school’s state of the school address.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tommy_SOS_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27336"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-27336" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tommy_SOS_350px.jpg" alt="tommy_sos_350px" width="350" height="286" /></a>When The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Head of School Tommy Adams addressed those in attendance in the Tracy Fieldhouse at last night’s state of the school address, he carefully laid out the results of six months of observation, collaboration and just plain hard work. He also addressed the changing face of independent schools in the United States and how going forward, the Academy will be “preparing a new generation of learners” and listening very closely to the voices within the community.

“We are here to listen and learn about what is important to you about your child’s education,” Adams told the parents. “Whether it be in the Early Learning Program or in grades 1 through 8, know that we care deeply about your children and are committed to making sure that they develop the core skills necessary for success in each phase of their educational journey here at the Academy and beyond.”

The following is the text of The Grosse Pointe Academy’s 2017 state of the school address delivered Tuesday, January 31, by Adams to parents, friends, alumni, faculty and staff in attendance.

<hr />

Good evening everyone and thank you for being here tonight.

Having spent much of my life in and around independent schools has provided me with the opportunity to gain a unique perspective on the manner in which this kind of educational option has changed and evolved. While I believe that there is no better environment for young people to learn and grow both socially and emotionally, I believe independent schools are at a critical juncture due to a shifting educational landscape that allows for more school choice and also a change in consumer behavior. Spending the past 23 years in the admission profession also allowed me to witness, first hand, the circumstances that are forcing independent schools to reevaluate the way in which they operate.

For most of their existence, independent schools experienced success by focusing on constructing programs that supported and aligned with their missions without having much concern for the external market. Small classes, quality teachers, physical and social safety, and a focus on a child’s moral development were just some of the qualities that attracted families to enroll their children in an independent school.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0220_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27338"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27338" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0220_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0220_1000px" width="1000" height="714" /></a>

Between 1990 and 2006, the independent school market experienced healthy enrollment growth and a strong brand mostly due to concerns of quality in the public school system and lack of other educational options. During this period, a large number of families committed themselves to ensuring that their children would have the opportunity to attend and reap the benefits of a private school education. Also during this cycle, there was immense focus on facility and technology enhancements and emerging discussions among experts in the field of education about the need to develop a new set of skills to better prepare young people for success in a rapidly changing world. The goal of these initiatives were to add to the advancement and quality of an independent school experience, however, in a number of schools it disrupted the core educational foundation of their work with children.

There is no question the world has changed, that young people are more socially and culturally aware than ever before and that schools must determine ways to better prepare their students to navigate this new normal. Technology and access to information will continue to require schools to rethink how they teach and how you parent.

It is clear the changing landscape has made for a more anxious and impatient world for students and parents alike. Schools are feeling the pressure to determine ways to integrate “21st Century” skill development into their programs while also trying to remain true to developing skills in traditional academic areas.

While I believe it is important to innovate and explore new ways to approach our work in the classroom, the implementation of programmatic change must demonstrate growth and value. A superficial approach to school change is a liability to the learning that occurs in our classrooms.

I am not suggesting that change should not take place, but that there needs to be a more thoughtful, mission-driven approach to implementing any kind of change here at the Academy. Additional, any revisions to the program must be a shared concept, not the work of one or a few.

I have spent my first six months here at the Academy meeting with and listening to all of the various constituencies of the school, observing how we as an institution approach our work with our students, and evaluating how we communicate with you the parent. I have also spent some time learning about and gaining an appreciation for the historical elements of GPA and the importance of its connection the Society of the Sacred Heart.

The most rewarding aspect of my time here at GPA has been the time that I have spent with your children. Whether it be drop-off greetings and handshakes, visiting classes in both school buildings, or sitting at the lunch table with them, it has been a real pleasure and a joy getting to know them. They have been courteous, willing to engage with me and even taking the initiative to politely demand more late starts and dress down days and insisting that I strongly consider abolishing homework. I love their persistence, sense of humor and intuitive nature.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SOS_home-image3_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27340"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27340" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SOS_home-image3_1000px.jpg" alt="sos_home-image3_1000px" width="1000" height="563" /></a>

I have also worked earnestly since I arrived in July to get to know and build trust and goodwill amongst faculty and staff. I sense that my leadership style and collaborative approach have served as a positive cultural shift but also something that has taken them some time to get used to.

Clearly, they have a great deal of love and admiration for this school and are committed to their work with your children in the classroom and in other school related activities. I am greatly appreciative of their enthusiasm for their work and willingness to be honest with me regarding their concerns about some of the cultural and organizational aspects of the school.

Additionally, I am greatly appreciative of your honest and conscientious feedback. Your input is critical and will continue to be as we implement the changes and revisions to our program.

The faculty and I want to thank you for continuing to believe in GPA. We know you have placed a great deal of faith in us to educate and nurture your children. I recognize there are some concerns here related to program, communication, and culture, however, I can assure you that your children are learning and developing both very important tangible and intangible skills that will be critically important to their future.

Yes, there are certainly things that we need to improve upon, but I don’t believe anything is permanently broken. The challenges that exist here at the Academy are primarily cultural and organizational. Decisions over the years have been made in a vacuum or rooted in anecdotal information.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a3814_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27339"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27339" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a3814_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a3814_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="731" /></a>

Establishing an institutional identity or brand requires a willingness to listen and assess feedback from all school constituents. Without the thoughtful input of a collection of school stakeholders, it is incredibly difficult to build a vision for success and growth.

The most fulfilling aspect of my work as a leader over the years has been observing groups of professions speaking honestly and openly about what will add the most value to a child’s experience in school. Building consensus and ownership is critical if schools are going to remain sustainable for the foreseeable future.

The insular method of leadership that has been prevalent in schools for quite some time is giving way to a more collaborative and strategic leadership approach. This shared concept is helping schools educate internal stakeholders on big-picture topics that are and will continue to affect programming, enrollment, fundraising and other aspects of school life.

I am happy to report that there is an emerging shift taking place here at the Academy that I believe will positively impact your child’s learning experience both in and out of the classroom.

After collecting a large amount of important data from a variety internal and external constituencies, a group of faculty, administrators and I have spent time evaluating this information and constructed an updated version of “The Portrait of a GPA Graduate.” Once we completed the profile, we then focused our attention on determining what curricular changes and revisions would be essential to better supporting our core values and beliefs.

The overall consensus was that we needed to get back to concentrating on developing the foundational skills that are critical for children from early childhood through the 8th grade.

We feel strongly that the following four characteristics – or <em>"portrait"</em> – of a Grosse Pointe Academy graduate embody what is critical to learning during this period of a child’s life and the reason you choose to enroll your children in our program.

The <strong>Grosse Pointe Academy graduate</strong> will:

<strong>• Reach their full academic, physical, and creative potential</strong>
- Students possess a strong liberal arts education
- Students are confident and competent oral and written communicators
- Students are proficient in mathematics
- Students think critically and are creative problem solvers
- Students have an appreciation for the fine and performing arts
- Students have an appreciation for the benefits of team athletics

<strong>• Be prepared for success in an ever-changing world </strong>
- Students are inter-culturally competent, honor individuality, and embrace diversity
- Students are persevering, and possess effective time management and organizational skills
- Students demonstrate technological literacy and ethical digital citizenship
- Students work collaboratively and guide others with confidence

<strong>• Possess intellectual curiosity and a lifelong love of learning</strong>
- Students have a sense of confidence and self-awareness about their strengths and weaknesses
- Students are flexible and willing to take intellectual risks

<strong>• Exhibit the highest moral character and embody Christian values</strong>
- Students show respect for themselves and others
- Students are kind, considerate, and stand up for others’ rights
- Students honor commitments
- Students have an appreciation for service and support for community

Now that we have determined what we want our students to know and be able to do, changes and revisions to our program will take place in order to better support this new portrait of a graduate. Our focus is to make sure our students are at the center of everything that we do and that the learning that takes place in our community will be of genuine value to your child’s future. Recognizing the significance of a quality pre-K-through-8 school experience, we firmly believe that the following curricular improvements will add depth to student learning and help support our educational objectives and programmatic sequence.

<strong>• Math and English Honors</strong> - To focus on making sure that classes are ability and achievement driven, not restricted by grade level, we will begin work to establish a math and English honors track with the goal of having it in place for the 2017-18 school year. As we tackle this initiative, we will focus our efforts on program design and requirements, staffing needs, and professional development support.
• Academic Schedule - We will establish more time in the class schedule for core academic subjects such as math and English. We are in the process of examining scheduling options and will have an update for you in the spring. A new academic schedule will be in place for the beginning of the 2017-18 school year.

<strong>• Math Program</strong> - We will explore other math program alternatives because there is a strong consensus among our math faculty that a change is needed if we are to add to depth the current math curriculum.

<strong>• Forensics</strong> - Forensics will become a requirement for graduation. This decision aligns with our belief that we need to better develop the oral and written communication skills in our students.

<strong>• Technology</strong> - While there is no question that educational technology integration is important, we believe that we need to take a step back and rethink the use of this tool in classroom. We want to make sure that the use of technology will add value to learning and not be a distraction to our students. We will not require 6th purchase an iPad for the 2017-18 school year.

<strong>• High School Placement Program</strong> - We will improve the placement program by beginning the process earlier in a student’s time at GPA so that we can get a better sense of school type and academic/extracurricular needs or requirements. This will allow us to better craft an individualized path for and determine the right school choice for each student.

<strong>• Extracurricular Activities and Specials</strong> - We will spend the spring and summer assessing our Extracurricular Programs and Specials to make sure that they support mission and add value to a child’s experience at the Academy.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future Changes:</span></strong>

<strong>• Dashboard</strong> - in response to your requests to enhance communication and to provide a better view of your child’s GPA journey, we are thinking about ways to better track and evaluate their progress while at the Academy. In the meantime, we are working to improve the delivery of this important information within our current database system.

<strong>• Project Based Learning Program</strong> - We plan to work on creating a 1-week intensive project based learning program that will focus on helping to develop new world skills while also supporting traditional skill development. We are in the process of researching this type of learning program that exist in other schools. We also believe that adding this type of program will provide us an opportunity to possibly partner with organizations in surrounding areas including the City of Detroit.

<strong>• Creation of a summer Academic Skills Program</strong> - We are in the early planning stages of creating a summer academic skills program that will help support our school year program and provide additional tutoring for students.

In summary. . . I have listened, learned a great deal, and believe firmly that we are beginning to build a better learning model for our students. While I know many of you may be eager for change to come quickly, I encourage you to remain patient as we want to make sure that we approach the work of programmatic change in a thoughtful and intentional manner. We look forward to determining ways to better partner with you so that can work together to enhance the overall educational experience for your children. We are here to listen and learn about what is important to you about your child’s education. Whether it be in the Early Learning Program or in grades 1 through 8, know that we care deeply about your children and are committed to making sure that they develop the core skills necessary for success in each phase of their educational journey here at the Academy and beyond.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Physician and lawyer talk about the school that helped make them who they are today.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27346" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WM-JM-Pic2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27346"><img class="wp-image-27346 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WM-JM-Pic2_1000px.jpg" alt="wm-jm-pic2_1000px" width="1000" height="735" /></a> James, left, and Walter Mosley say their current career success would not have been possible if not for the Early School-to-eighth-grade education they received at the Academy.[/caption]

When you get Walter and James Mosley together to talk about The Grosse Pointe Academy, the love and appreciation they have for the school is palpable. After all, according to both of them, their current career success would not have been possible if not for the Early School-to-eighth-grade education they received at the Academy.

“I don’t think we can emphasize enough the incredible opportunity we received by going to The Grosse Pointe Academy,” said 1993 alum James Mosley, a cardiac physician based in Los Angeles. “Considering what was available to us in our neighborhood schools, even the private schools in our area, I am truly convinced that I would not have been able to even get into my undergrad programs in college if not for the foundation from The Grosse Pointe Academy.”

For Walter Mosley, who graduated from GPA in 1992 and who also lives in the Los Angeles area, it was not only the academics, it was some of the “intangibles” gained from his Academy experience.

“Character development,” Walter said with much emphasis. “From an academics perspective, especially with science and math, the foundation was super strong. But what I grew to appreciate later and something that is very important to me now was the focus on character development at the Academy, and definitely the school’s emphasis on being very family-oriented, and on becoming not only a good person, but a good person with integrity.”

For the Mosley brothers, though, it’s not just talk. They both decided recently that they would like to establish a scholarship fund so that more students who may not otherwise have the chance can attend their alma mater.

“Because the Academy was such an important part of our career and success, James and I came up with this scholarship to help other kids who grow up in similar situations as us, and to give them the same opportunities we had,” Walter Mosley said. “We want to make a difference in a way that we can be proud of.”

The Mosleys are in discussions with GPA officials on the specific details of the scholarship, the details of which will be announced at a later date.

<strong>From the Academy to Harvard and a wildly growing and eclectic career</strong>

After graduating from the Academy in 1992 and Cass Technical High School four years later, Walter Mosley, who operates a boutique entertainment law firm in LA, matriculated to the University of Michigan where he earned an undergrad degree in computer engineering. He then received a Master of Science degree from U-M in information, economics and management with a specialization in incentive-centered designed.

[caption id="attachment_27347" align="alignright" width="175"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/W_Mosley_A_Rose_175px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27347"><img class="wp-image-27347 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/W_Mosley_A_Rose_175px.jpg" alt="w_mosley_a_rose_175px" width="175" height="182" /></a> Academy alum Walter Mosley ('92) is with one of his clients, Amber Rose, at a function in Los Angeles.[/caption]

After Michigan, Mosley turned to the Harvard Law School for his law degree and the Dean’s Award, which was granted to him by current Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. He then clerked for Judge Damon J. Keith on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Currently, he is a member of the state bars of California and New York as well as the Federal Tax Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Currently, Mosley’s firm represents a huge cadre of social influencers and entertainers, including Debbie Allen, Amber Rose, Phylicia Rashad, Blac Chyna, and Will Smith and Harry Smith of Overbrook Entertainment.

In addition to his entertainment clients, Mosley said he also represents funds, high-net worth individuals and small businesses in a variety of corporate finance, film finance, private equity, merger and acquisition and corporate advisory matters. Further, he handles trademark, copyright, licensing and general corporate matters as well as representing producers, production companies and labels in film, music, television and fashion projects.

On the creative side, with his producing partner, Amber Rose, Mosley is the executive producer of the “Amber Rose Show” (now on MTV) as well as the #1 Show on E! Online, “Rob and Chyna.” In film, he’s also produced the feature film, “Sister Code,” and a new Smith Global/Sony Pictures release called “Valley of Bones,” which debuts in March.

A very busy guy, to be sure. But when it comes to the Academy, he keeps the time he spent there in a very special place close to his heart.

“With respect to the ‘family’ thing I talked about earlier, I believe I can still remember the first and last names of all my classmates,” he said. “And I consider them still my ‘family’ even though I don’t get back to Michigan that often.”

Walter Mosley also has special memories of his history classes and the various class trips that included Washington, DC, and Stratford, Ontario, for the Shakespeare festivals.

“History was exciting, interesting, but hard,” he said, “and I also remember James and I playing tennis together at GPA where we learned a lot about the game.”

Mosley also recalled becoming very comfortable with technology and computers at GPA, which he said was extremely helpful for him during his undergrad in engineering at the University of Michigan.

<strong>From the Academy to Northwestern to med school to cardiology</strong>

Like Walter, his brother James also graduated from Cass Tech. But unlike Walter, who attended U-M, James went on to Northwestern University and received a BS in biomedical engineering. He then was accepted to medical school at the University of Illinois after which he did an internship at the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University Program, Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Jesse Brown VA Hospital.

[caption id="attachment_27348" align="alignleft" width="175"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/james_mosley_93_edit_175px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27348"><img class="wp-image-27348 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/james_mosley_93_edit_175px.jpg" alt="james_mosley_93_edit_175px" width="175" height="213" /></a> 1992 Academy alum James Mosley is an interventional cardiologist at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, part of Kaiser Permanente, in Fontana, California.[/caption]

Following that, James did a fellowship in interventional cardiology and peripheral intervention in the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California, at the Scripps Green Hospital, which led to his current position as an interventional cardiologist at Kaiser Foundation Hospital, part of Kaiser Permanente, in Fontana, California.

While at Kaiser, Mosley began and led the TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) program (2014), co-founded a special mitral clip program (2016) and now routinely performs high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention that includes ventricular assist devices.

James Mosley still well-remembers The Grosse Pointe Academy. And like Walter, it is with tremendous affection.

“When I think back to my entire education — I mean, as a physician, I did many years when you count undergrad and medical school and beyond,” he said. “Out of all that academic experience, I am probably most fond and proud of my Grosse Pointe Academy years. It was a great environment. I loved going to school each day. I enjoyed the friends I made there. And while the classes were definitely difficult and rigorous, at the time, I don’t think I appreciated just how well we were being prepared for the next levels.”

He said one of his favorite teachers was Mr. (Michael) Fultz, who taught biology at the Academy.

“So I’ve always been big fan of the sciences, which is one of the reasons I went into medicine, but Mr. Fultz’s classes were amazing,” Mosley said. “In biology, we had this book that listed about 50 trees, and most kids don’t get the opportunity to be on a campus where you can actually find most of the trees in the book. And species of birds that we’d also find. I mean, it was amazing! For me it was just lots of fun while we were learning. I still have great memories of those things.”

James Mosley then gets a bit more resolute in tone.

“What an opportunity it was for us back then going to The Grosse Pointe Academy,” he said. “Especially considering that high school was kind of a ‘wash’ for me. But GPA is a huge emphasis for both Walter and me. We thought of this scholarship we are proposing because of what we were afforded back then at GPA, and how it’s propelled us in our respective careers. And it’s why we are very serious about wanting to contribute to kids who come from similar neighborhoods and situations and give back that same opportunity to others.”

GPA’s chess masters fared well this past weekend at the Michigan Elementary/Primary Team Championship tourney, which was sponsored by the Michigan Chess Association and held at the Baker College Student Center in Auburn Hills.

According to GPA Assistant Head of School for Instruction and Grades 1-8 Principal Lawrence DeLuca, who was on hand at the event, Charlie Wade (3rd grade), Jack Green (2nd grade), Oscar DeLuca (2nd grade), and Lindsay Darke (2nd grade) placed a very respectable fifth in the K-3 division.

“Additionally, Lindsay Darke received an individual silver medal for winning four out of her five matches,” DeLuca added. “We had another team that competed in the K-3 division made up of Charlie Tourangeau (2nd grade), Dane Willson (1st grade), Luke Brennan (1st grade), and Jennie Jerome (2nd grade), but while they performed very well, unfortunately they did not place.”

Academy teacher Holly Willson manages the team, and they are coached by Jack Kahn and Lou Cyccone from All the King's Men Chess and Brain Games Inc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Fifth-grade teacher says she treats her students the way she would want someone to treat her own children.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27464" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a2886edit-crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27464"><img class="wp-image-27464 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a2886edit-crop_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a2886edit-crop_1000px" width="1000" height="692" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy 5th-grade teacher Holly Willson first arrived on campus six years ago.[/caption]

When Grosse Pointe Academy 5th-grade teacher Holly Willson first arrived on campus six years ago, she was floored. She was floored because even though she’d been teaching already for a number of years in two different schools, she could not believe the level of aptitude, talent and poise that GPA students exhibited on a regular basis.

“I will never forget my first year at The Grosse Pointe Academy,” said Willson, who grew up in Sault Sainte Marie in Michigan’s upper peninsula. “I was blown away by the talent of the students on many occasions.”

One memorable occasion that came to mind for Willson was an assembly in which a young first grader at GPA stood up and made a presentation in front of the entire school and recited a speech by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

“At the time, I did not know who the student was, but I remember him standing behind the podium and looking so small,” she said. “However, when he began to speak, he was anything but small! He had so much passion, determination and confidence in his voice, and he had memorized the entire speech! I had never before witnessed such a young child speak so well and confidently in front of so many people. It truly was an awe-inspiring moment in my life.”

For Willson, her life in teaching began in Traverse City where she taught in a multi-age classroom of 4th, 5th, and 6th graders for two years at Grand Traverse Academy, a public pre K-12 charter school authorized by Lake Superior State University. Willson had attended college at LSSU and received a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education and a Master’s Degree in curriculum and instruction.

While still teaching at Grand Traverse Academy, Willson said she moved back to her hometown after meeting her future husband there.

“I traveled home from Traverse City for Thanksgiving break and met my future husband, Alek,” she said. “We quickly fell in love, so I finished that second school year at GTA and moved back to Sault Sainte Marie, where I hired on at Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting Anishnabe charter school, which serves elementary- and middle-school students in the city.”

At Bahweting, Willson held various positions, including teacher’s aid, gym teacher, art teacher and academic service provider. Ultimately, she had to move south again — much farther south — to metro Detroit because her husband, a captain in the Michigan Army National Guard, was transferred to the area.

“When it was time to move to Grosse Pointe, I was extremely sad to leave my ‘family’ at Bahweting school,” she said, “but I also knew I had many adventures ahead of me.”

Those adventures included a job at the Academy and a school perfect for Willson’s own kids, which became even more apparent for her after she witnessed her first graduation ceremony at GPA.

“I remember from my first year at The Grosse Pointe Academy that when I attended eighth-grade commencement, the graduates were all so very well-spoken, exhibited high moral standards, had many amazing achievements throughout their years at the Academy, and that they all were clearly beyond ready for high school,” Willson recalled. “I will never forget going home that night to tell my husband about the graduation ceremony. I said to him, ‘We really need to send our children to The Grosse Pointe Academy!’”

Hence, the next year, her son was enrolled in Kate Kingsley’s preschool class, and then her daughter began attending a few years later when she turned three. “It was one of the best decisions we could have ever made for our children!”

It seems that decision is working out just fine for mom as well.

“I feel truly blessed to have my teaching position at the Academy,” Willson said. “I look forward to going to school each day and contributing to the growth and development of my young students. I love them unconditionally and teach and encourage them to be active participants in their own education. When I look at them, I think to myself, ‘This is someone’s dear child.’ I treat them the way I would want someone to treat my own children, which really is to nurture, challenge and inspire.”

It also appears that Willson’s complete devotion to her students does not go unnoticed.

“Holly is a very dedicated and caring teacher who’s always willing to pitch in and try new things,” said Lawrence DeLuca, who is the Academy’s assistant head of school for instruction and principal of grades 1-8. “Her students love being in her class, and she always pushes them to do their best, particularly in their writing. Whenever I walk by her room, I find myself marveling over the essays her students write in her class.”

For Willson, as much as she loves teaching at the Academy, when she is not in class, she looks very much forward to her family time as well.

“I really enjoy spending my free time with my family, especially in the summer,” she said. “We often go fishing on the weekends and have nightly bonfires to make S’mores. We also enjoy biking, swimming, camping, rollerblading and walking. And, when the weather is not so favorable outside, my family and I play a lot of board games and cards, have dance parties in the basement and watch movies together.”

Most parents of young children soon to be entering school have heard of “Montessori,” but many may not know what it’s about and how it differs from more traditional education.

The Grosse Pointe Academy, home to Michigan's longest continuous-running Montessori program, is pleased to offer up a five-minute YouTube video produced by “Montessori Madman” Trevor Eissler that in very simple “hand-drawn” terms and images clearly defines the difference between the innovative Montessori program and conventional elementary education.

The video is below. Enjoy!

<em>NOTE: The Grosse Pointe Academy hosts its <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/art-and-academic-powered-open-house-is-march-8/" target="_blank">2017 Art Show and Admission Open House</a></strong> on Wednesday, March 8, between 6 and 8 p.m.)</em>

In a blog published in 2015 by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://ageofmontessori.org/" target="_blank">Age of Montessori</a></span>, the “big” differences between Montessori and traditional pedagogies are spelled out in ten main bullet points. Acknowledging that the list probably could include more than 100 differences, it is perhaps still useful to highlight the major ones.

Based in Bozeman, Montana, Age of Montessori is a private organization that trains and certifies Montessori teachers online and in-person, as well as educates parents on the many aspects of early childhood education.

The Grosse Pointe Academy offers the longest continuously operating <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">Montessori program</a></strong></span> in the state of Michigan.

<strong>Ten BIG Differences between Montessori and Traditional Education</strong>

<em>What is the difference between Montessori and traditional education?</em>

By Emilyj, ageofmontessori.org

If you are new to Montessori education, often the first question you might ask is “what makes Montessori different?” Truly, the answer to that question is immense! So, in an effort to make this bountiful banquet of information a little more digestible, I have organized some of the key concepts into these ten BIG differences:

<strong>1. The Prepared Environment:</strong> Montessori classrooms are prepared in advance based on observations of the Montessori students’ individual needs. They include student-centered lessons and activities. Traditional classrooms are based on teacher-centered lessons or activities.

<strong>2. Active vs. Passive:</strong> Montessori lessons are hands-on and active. Students discover information for themselves. Traditional school lessons are often orated to students who listen passively, memorize and take tests.

<strong>3. Give ‘Em Time:</strong> In the Montessori classroom, children work on lessons as long as need be, and interruptions are avoided whenever possible. Time limitations are mandated by arbitrary schedules in traditional classrooms.

<strong>4. The Teachers’ Role:</strong> Montessori teachers act as guides and consultants to students on a one-on-one basis. They assist each child along his or her own learning path. Traditionally, the pace and order of each lesson is predetermined. The teacher must deliver the same lesson, at the same pace, in the same order, for all of the students.

<strong>5. Age Groups and Grade-levels:</strong> In Montessori schools, “grade-levels” are flexible and determined by the child’s developmental range, i.e., 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15, and 15-18 years of age. In traditional schools, grade levels are not flexible and strictly defined by chronological age within a twelve-month period.

<strong>6. Adaptable Curricula:</strong> Montessori curricula expand in response to the students’ needs. Traditional curricula are predetermined without regard to student needs.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0225-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-26955"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26955" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bd4a0225-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0225-edit-crop_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a>

<strong>7. Pace Yourself:</strong> The individual child’s work pace is honored and encouraged in the Montessori classroom. Traditional classrooms expect all children to work at the same pace.

<strong>8. Self-Made Self-Esteem:</strong> Montessorians understand that the child’s self-esteem comes from an internal sense of pride in his or her own accomplishments. In traditional classrooms, self-esteem is thought to come from external judgement and validation.

<strong>9. For the Love of Learning:</strong> Montessori curricula are intended to appeal to the child’s innate hunger for knowledge. Children learn to love learning. Traditional curricula focus on standardized test performance and grades. Children learn because it is mandatory.

<strong>10. Change is Good:</strong> The Montessori Method was created by Maria Montessori and is based on a lifetime of study and observation with regard to the way children really learn. Traditional education is based on. . .well. . .tradition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Annual Academy open house showcased art, academics and Michigan's longest continuously operating Montessori program.</strong>

<a href="https://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0269_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27386"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27386" src="https://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0269_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0269_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="1183" /></a>

The Grosse Pointe Academy was humming with activity on March 15 when this venerable beacon of academic innovation on Lake Shore Road opened its doors to the community for the school’s annual Open House and Art Show.

In addition to opening all classrooms and hallways for visitors to roam and explore — every nook, cranny and alcove of the Academy’s Valade Art Loft &amp; Gallery were filled with artwork as students in grades K through 8 assembled nearly six months worth of hard work and creative expression.

Visitors also were able to experience the school’s very unique take on technology education for grades 1 through 8, which GPA calls its “STEAM” program.

[caption id="attachment_27390" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0252-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27390"><img class="wp-image-27390 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a0252-edit-crop_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0252-edit-crop_1000px" width="1000" height="682" /></a> The Grosse Pointe Academy offers the longest continuously operating Montessori program in the state of Michigan.[/caption]

According to school officials, three years ago the Academy integrated instruction in some of the more traditional STEM subjects such as science, technology and mathematics with classes in art, writing and literature to create the school’s own version of a “STEAM” program, or "science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics."

Along with cutting-edge technology in every classroom at GPA that includes the Grosse Pointes’ only one-to-one iPad school program for grades one through eight, the integration of the arts and technology has been implemented across the entire spectrum of courses at the Academy, giving all students a continuum of instruction from the Lower School through grade 8.

[caption id="attachment_27388" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a26251_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27388"><img class="wp-image-27388 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/bd4a26251_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a26251_1000px" width="1000" height="775" /></a> With a curriculum that includes language, math, science, technology and the arts, The Grosse Pointe Academy is providing a strong foundation of academics in an environment where every child is nurtured, challenged and inspired every day.[/caption]

Open house visitors also witnessed how GPA teachers are turning Academy students into makers, inventors, engineers, and dreamers in the school’s “innovative” Innovation &amp; Design Center, which includes capabilities for robotics, 3D printing and a host of other challenging technical activities.

In addition, prospective families learned more about the school’s innovative electives program for middle school students. Called "Real-World Experiences and Applied Learning" (R.E.A.L.), these classes — which exist outside the school’s core curriculum — typically focus on critical thinking and problem-solving activities that require students to propose and create solutions for real-world problems. R.E.A.L. classes scheduled for the current school year include the 442 Project, which is retelling the story of Detroit through creative writing; cryptography, where students will learn how to send and receive secret messages using both historical and modern methods; and CSI, which takes students on a journey to learn crime scene analysis.

Additional R.E.A.L. classes involve graphic arts and design, a student-centered Grosse Pointe Academy Historical Society, and Sharing the Melting Pot, in which students explore different world cultures through the study of food.

<strong>The <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/art-and-academic-powered-open-house-is-march-8/" target="_blank">2017 Open House and Art Show a</a>t The Grosse Pointe Academy is tonight!</strong>

On Wednesday, Feb. 15, many of The Grosse Pointe Academy's young alumni visited their former school to catch up with fellow graduates. They hope to follow in the footsteps of some of the older alumni from the Academy who are making a real difference in the world today. . . alumni who have attended or are attending some of the finest universities in the world. Alumni who work in diverse industries and fields, including finance, music, acting, manufacturing, marketing, engineering, human resources, government, law, public service and many, many more.

Below you’ll find just a few of those alums as well as what they’ve been saying lately about the education they received at The Grosse Pointe Academy.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/C_Worth_edit3_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27497"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27497" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/C_Worth_edit3_1000px.jpg" alt="c_worth_edit3_1000px" width="1000" height="660" /></a>

“I loved the small class sizes at GPA, and since Mercy High School also had small classes, it was a great transition. I felt completely prepared for high school, especially in science. As a matter of fact, I attribute my high grades in college science also to my GPA teachers. The Academy created my love of science, and I still remember many of it today. I’m even still great at classifying trees!” — <strong>Catherine (Worth) Chittick (’88) professional actress in Los Angeles</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cargas_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27496"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27496" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cargas_1000px.jpg" alt="cargas_1000px" width="1000" height="699" /></a>

“Some of the most lasting lessons that GPA teaches young people include manners and respect for others. I recall losing a baseball game at the Academy in second or third grade and being rather upset. But the coach took the time to talk to me about sportsmanship, the importance of leaving the competitiveness on the field, and looking forward to a rematch tomorrow. Those are heavy concepts for a six year old to take in, but I did, and it has stayed with me today and will be with me probably forever.” — <strong>James Cargas, (’80), energy attorney based in Houston</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ronquillo-5C_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27488"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27488" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ronquillo-5C_1000px.jpg" alt="ronquillo-5c_1000px" width="1000" height="693" /></a>

“All of the teachers at GPA were very encouraging and supportive of my passion for music. Mrs. Chrisner, our music teacher, always found ways to utilize every student’s talent in all of the various programs and plays. One great memory for me involved one of my English teachers at GPA, who played drums in a local rock band and was actually playing at one of the school dances. He invited me up to play ‘La Bamba,’ which I had just learned. I think the movie had just come out. Ironically, I recently met David Hidalgo from Los Lobos at a festival we were both playing, and I told him that story.” — <strong>R.J. Ronquillo (’90) musician and composer who’s played with Stevie Wonder, Ricky Martin and Thompson Square</strong>

“Our transition from GPA to high school was rewarding, first of all, because we were introduced to diversity at such a young age. Growing up in Detroit, we did not have much exposure to diverse populations and resources. But the Academy certainly prepared us physically, mentally, and emotionally to have those conversations about race and identity as well as how to interact and engage with diverse individuals through the lens of race, ethnicity, religion and socioeconomic status.” — <strong>Christian Love (’04) “Leadership in Higher Education” M.Ed. program coordinator and second-year doctoral student in higher education at the University of Washington College of Education in Seattle. He graduated from GPA with his twin brother Christopher.</strong>

“I felt so prepared coming from GPA to Liggett in terms of my ability to manage my workload and also my ability to thoughtfully contribute to class discussions. I remember during freshmen year at Liggett that a lot of students [non-GPA grads] were complaining about the amount of homework, and that all of the GPA grads could easily handle it. Also, all of the Academy students seemed in a way more thoughtful and even more mature, and could easily hold meaningful discussions in class.” — <strong>Grace Andreasen (’14) junior at University Liggett School</strong>

“GPA provided me an excellent learning structure to build upon at Grosse Pointe South High School and then at Tulane University and Wayne State university law school. I really appreciated all the teachers and staff that were so important in my schooling at the Academy. I began at GPA in pre-school in about 1982, as I recall, and I still have fond memories of many teachers and administrators—especially my kindergarten teacher, Ann Carson, my 4th- and 5th-Grade teacher, Bob Lapadot, and those summer trips with our science teacher, Mike Fultz.” — <strong>Patrick Ball, a foreign service officer with the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C.</strong>

“I feel grateful that at the Academy we were all pushed to do a bit of everything — academics, sports, chorus, art, drama, etc. I didn’t fully realize it at the time, but now as an adult, I still meet people and notice how integral those small things are that contribute to making a person so well-rounded.” — <strong>Paige Russell (’04), graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design who operates an art studio and business in Austin, Texas.</strong>

“The Academy certainly prepared me for high school and beyond. Academically, of course, across all subjects, GPA is phenomenal. Beyond that, though, the Academy always encouraged creativity and compassion. There’s something magical about the building and the grounds, and the curriculum actively nourished creative thinking.” — <strong>Chelsea Baumgarten (’03), writer and poet now living and working in New York City</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hishmeh2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27511"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27511" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hishmeh2_1000px.jpg" alt="hishmeh2_1000px" width="1000" height="612" /></a>

“Academically, I felt I was extremely prepared, especially in science, French, math and English. Coming into a private high school like Liggett, the academic expectations were high and I felt I was ready. I believe that GPA has influenced me in many ways in my life and career, but I think what has been most important is that at the Academy, you were always taught to treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself. That has been huge for me.” — <strong>Meghan (Brady) Hishmeh (’85), post-op orthopaedic surgery nurse and boys high school hockey coach in Montville, New Jersey</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27520" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WM-JM-Pic2_1000px-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27520"><img class="wp-image-27520 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/WM-JM-Pic2_1000px-1.jpg" alt="wm-jm-pic2_1000px" width="1000" height="735" /></a> James, left, and Walter Mosley say their current career success would not have been possible if not for the Early School-to-eighth-grade education they received at the Academy.[/caption]

“Besides the academics, character development was an important takeaway for me at GPA. From an academics perspective, especially with science and math, the foundation was super strong. But what I grew to appreciate later and something that is very important to me now was the focus on character development at the Academy, and definitely the school’s emphasis on being very family-oriented, and on becoming not only a good person, but a good person with integrity.” — <strong>Walter Mosely (’92), lawyer in Los Angeles</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Leonie-Leslie2_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27545"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27545" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Leonie-Leslie2_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="leonie-leslie2_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="773" /></a>

“I received many benefits from attending GPA. The well-rounded education at the Academy has given me the opportunity to be successful in various subjects. But besides its excellent academic program, I was well-prepared for the future because of the skills I learned in GPA classes such as art class, the music classes, creative movement, P.E., Christian Life, computer and library classes, all of which has allowed me to find my passion both inside and beyond academics.” — <strong>Léonie Leslie (’12), MSU undergrad and member of the Grosse Pointe South Academic Hall of Fame</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sasha.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27498"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27498" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sasha.jpg" alt="sasha" width="1000" height="727" /></a>

“GPA is still the amazing place I remember as a student, and it continues to instill life-changing experiences and relationships in its students and teachers each and every day. Truly something for every type of student. For me, this was how you teach children.” — <strong>Sasha (Ovshinsky) Murphy (’89), dean of students, physical ed teacher for grades 4-8, NJHS/Student Council advisor and community service coordinator at The Grosse Pointe Academy</strong>

“My Grosse Pointe Academy experience gave me the well-rounded educational foundation so critical to high school and college success. I attended GPA from preschool to grade eight and what I now realize is that the tradition and rigor that characterize a GPA education is in fact what enabled me to engage in more unorthodox means of learning in my high school years. In other words, I was so comfortable and well-versed in my academics after graduating from the Academy, I was far more open to the idea of alternative-learning methods as I matured in the context of an art school.” — <strong>George Spica (’11), graduate of Interlochen Arts Academy currently pursuing his art education in London where he attends the Slade School of Fine Art at University College, the highest ranked art school in the UK.</strong>

“I loved attending GPA so much, and of all the memories of my life, the ones of being there are some of the most dear to me. While I was only a student at the school for four years total, what I learned and experienced there created such an important foundation for the years that followed, and so many things I learned have stayed with me, and have probably influenced me in ways I’m not even aware of. This includes what I learned in the classroom, interacting with the other students, and just being in those incredible buildings, and on the grounds of the school.” — <strong>Jesse Paris Smith, musician and activist who along with her mother, the famed singer/musician Patti Smith, is advocating for climate change solutions around the world.</strong>

“GPA not only prepared me for the rigors of high school work but it definitely taught me the priceless skills of time management and perseverance, which one needs in abundance in this business.” — <strong>Carrie Gentry (’03), alum and business owner in Detroit</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/geter-crop3_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27515"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27515" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/geter-crop3_1000px.jpg" alt="geter-crop3_1000px" width="1000" height="488" /></a>

“There is no doubt that The Grosse Pointe Academy provided me the academic foundation that later became a major part of my commitment to academic prowess, scholastic excellence, and care for the community. For a quick example, I remember knowing how to write a five-paragraph essay with ease in 9th grade and that other students were starting at a loss. But to be fair, GPA’s impact is vastly more than that. At GPA, I was exposed to the lifestyles of business owners and other pillars of the community. It was there that I was first challenged to become the global citizen that Wellesley College would later mold me to be. GPA was the birthplace of my commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equality as a life’s mission and daily practice. It also was at GPA where I first learned the science behind the birds and the bees, sang and danced on my first stage, and dragged my mother to the mall to purchase my first pair of Birkenstock slip-ins [which I still have!]. All I can say is thank you to all of the teachers, staff, stakeholders, parents, classmates, and mentors who I was too young to truly appreciate at that time. — <strong>Chanel Geter (’06), Wellesley grad pursuing a career in human-resources management and professional-development consulting</strong>

“I always felt very well-prepared and rarely was I in over my head in high school. I definitely think that trickled on down the line to college as well. I honestly loved all my teachers there. The music instructor, Mrs. [Marion] Chrisner, my pre-school teacher, Mrs. Beth [Plotzke], my second grade teacher, Mrs. [Renee] Martin, my fourth and fifth grade teacher, Mrs. [Barbara] Markus, just to name a few. Everyone was always so nurturing and kind. I also made so many wonderful lifelong friends at that school. To this day, I live just a few blocks away in New York City from some of my best friends that I met in preschool at GPA. And we’re as close now as we were then.” — <strong>Victoria Reed, singer-songwriter who recently completed a nationwide tour</strong>

“Just thinking about the Academy makes me want to cry — but in a good way. GPA was a game changer that led directly to me doing so well in high school, college and law school, and that it also gave her the drive she needed to become a successful attorney.I have to say it was that unique approach to education at the Academy, the very individualized approach that emboldened all of us. Every child. . . we all felt like the world was our oyster. It made learning fun and definitely helped to boost our self confidence, which was critical for us at that age. In the Academy at the time, and in my class especially, there were kids from every walk of life, with very diverse cultural backgrounds. We were diverse racially and diverse socioeconomically. There were rich kids. There were poor kids. A very, very diverse group of students, who while we were all quite different, never noticed any of those differences.”  — <strong>Megan Bonanni (’80), civil rights attorney practicing in Royal Oak; also was commencement speaker at 2016 graduation.</strong>

“I definitely think the Academy helped prepare me academically for high school and even for college in that I developed good study habits and an academic discipline that continued to serve me throughout my years as a student after GPA.” — <strong>Natalie Relich (’01), manages non-profit coalition of technical, social and commercial innovators who have developed a low-cost system to purify water in impoverished countries</strong>

“The Grosse Pointe Academy offered such a wide variety within every class, we were able to explore our interests in many ways. Then, when I got to Grosse Pointe South, I was able to choose the classes I wanted based more on my interests. With the help of the Academy, I was able to broaden my visions beyond the norm and find my own niche.” — <strong>Carmella Goree (’11), named a REBUILD Detroit Scholar, which brought from the University of Detroit Mercy a scholarship totaling more than $140,000</strong>

“The Academy definitely prepared me to be a leader. Because of the small class sizes at GPA, we had the opportunity to be in the limelight quite often and that gave me the confidence to pursue leadership opportunities in high school. My freshman year at Cranbrook was relatively easy for me since I was so far ahead academically. I’ve noticed that many other students from The Grosse Pointe Academy also end up in leadership positions at Cranbrook, ranging from class president to editor of the school newspaper.” — <strong>Joseph Cavataio (’11), graduate from Cranbrook-Kingswood, now at the University of Michigan studying physics and engineering</strong>

“My time at GPA really helped me gain the confidence and self-awareness I needed to make the choice to go to the IA in the first place.” — <strong>James Raudabaugh (’12), graduate of the prestigious International Academy, an International Baccalaureate school. He currently is studying film in college.</strong>

Hilary (Zaranek) Anderson, a 1999 GPA alum, has been getting notable press recently for her work on maintaining a balanced ecosystem in the Yellowstone area of the United States. She believes all living creatures there can coexist with nature and she has shown a remarkable willingness “to teach the next generation to live in harmony with the land.”

In the November/December 2016 issue of Montana Magazine that focused on “Women in a grassland,” Anderson, who is married to a fourth-generation rancher and currently residing with her husband and their four children in the Tom Miner Basin in Montana near Yellowstone, was featured for undertaking her project designed to enable coexistence between cattle and natural wildlife in the region.

Anderson also was profiled in a similar 2015 article published by the Natural Resources Defense Council (and reproduced below) on how her cattle ranch is trying to ensure its operations also benefit wildlife, including predators such as wolves.

A wildlife biologist, Anderson focuses much of her energy on how the land and its inhabitants utilize old and new strategies to live in harmony in the Yellowstone region. She also has done much work on cattle vs. wolf research in Yellowstone and Canada to help ease that usually fraught relationship.

In addition, Anderson was featured in a photo essay last year by Erika Larsen for National Geographic magazine.

<strong>Roam, Roam on the Range</strong>

<em><strong>This Montana cattle ranch is trying to ensure its operations benefit wildlife—and yes, that means wolves, too.</strong></em>

By Alisa Opar

(For more on the NRDC and the work they do: <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/work" target="_blank">https://www.nrdc.org/work</a>)

On a cool, sunny May morning, Hilary (Zaranek) Anderson set out on horseback from her log house in southwestern Montana with one thing on her mind: wolves.

Anderson lives in the Centennial Valley, an immense expanse of grass- and wetlands ringed by the ragged peaks of the Centennial and Gravelly mountain ranges. The handful of people, mostly ranchers, who call this place home are vastly outnumbered by animals. Trumpeter swans and sandhill cranes are among the more than 260 bird species that inhabit the sweeping landscape, along with river otters, deer, elk, and, of course, loads of cattle. As grizzly and gray wolf populations have recovered in Yellowstone National Park (about 20 miles away), predators have been joining the ranks in increasing numbers, too.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/zaranek_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27561"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27561" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/zaranek_1000px.jpg" alt="zaranek_1000px" width="1000" height="668" /></a>

Cattle ranchers have traditionally been hostile to large carnivores; wolves were nearly hunted, trapped, and poisoned to extinction in the Lower 48 a few decades ago, due in part to the threat they posed to livestock. Anderson, who has done wolf research in Yellowstone and Canada and now works for the Centennial Valley Association, is trying to ease that relationship. She is testing whether range riders on horseback and ATV can minimize conflicts between livestock and predators.

Anderson and two other riders she oversees are looking out for cattle from a half-dozen ranches in the area, including the J Bar L, a 30,000-acre operation where her husband works.

These cowboys, who all happen to be women, are just one of the ways J Bar L is trying to manage its grass-fed beef operation to benefit livestock, people, wildlife, and habitat. To figure out how best to do that, the ranch works with numerous partners, including NRDC (disclosure), the Nature Conservancy, and the Sage Grouse Initiative. Scientists are studying, for instance, whether structures that mimic beaver dams, installed to rehabilitate stream channels, may benefit Arctic grayling, a rare native fish that sports flamboyant, turquoise-spotted dorsal fins. And on two greater sage grouse leks, biologists are investigating what factors enable populations of these iconic—and possibly soon-to-be-endangered—birds to nest successfully.

But the ranch’s primary focus is moving the herd along in a way that mimics how bison once roamed: regularly rotating grazing to allow pastures to recover for months or even years between munching sessions, and ensuring the animals don’t cause lasting harm to sensitive areas, like springs and leks. As the herd chomps along, the ranchers put up portable, wildlife-friendly electric fences to keep them from wandering.

“People are willing to pay a premium for sustainably raised beef,” says J Bar L Ranch general manager Bryan Ulring. Last year, through Yellowstone Grassfed Beef, the ranch sold about 145,000 pounds of meat (or roughly 600,000 servings) to consumers across the country.

<strong>A new attitude</strong>

Despite the throwback to bison behavior, this is a thoroughly modern approach. Ranchers have traditionally turned out their cattle to graze largely unattended. But with predators rebounding, J Bar L and other operations in the Centennial Valley and Tom Miner Basin are taking a different tack, relying on Anderson and the other range riders to patrol herds and keep an eye out for sick, injured, and dead animals. They also gather and settle cattle in the evening, part of an ongoing effort to rekindle the herd instinct. The mere presence of humans acts as a deterrent against attacks, Anderson says.

Animals go missing from ranches for a slew of reasons, including predation, poisonous plants, lightning (yes, really), and brisket disease, which can cause heart failure in cows at high altitudes. The riders help get to the bottom of what’s causing deaths and disappearances out on the range because, as Anderson says, “You can’t make good management decisions based on myth.”

That’s why she was out early that May morning, scouting for predator activity in the days before thousands of cattle would arrive for the summer. Grizzlies, of which five or six roam the valley, killed one calf last summer, as well as an adult cow—no small feat considering the bear likely weighed half as much as the 1,400 pound ungulate. This time, Anderson saw evidence of wolves. “I found a really great hot spot,” she says while we sit at her kitchen table the day after the recon mission. “There were tons of tracks.” She says it looks like there may be three packs carving out territory in the valley this year, up from two in 2014.

Last year, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana were home to an estimated 1,657 wolves in 263 packs with a total of 75 breeding pairs, according to the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Program. The canids were confirmed as the killers of 140 cattle, 172 sheep, 4 dogs, a horse, and a donkey. Private and state agencies shelled out almost $275,000 in compensation for wolves damaging livestock. Wolves died, too, of course—ranchers and wildlife managers culled 161 of them for coming into conflict with livestock or other wildlife.

Rekindling the herd instinct is key to protecting cattle from wolf and grizzly attacks, says J Bar L Ranch general manager Ulring. He points to how the range riders encourage cattle to move as a herd and stick together, rather than run and scatter, when carnivores draw near—the old safety-in-numbers approach employed by animals ranging from bison to walruses to fish. Since J Bar L first started using range riders a few years ago, it hasn’t lost a single animal to predation when herds stay intact.

“Even last year, when we had cattle right by an active wolf den, we didn’t lose any,” says Ulring. “Cattle or wolves.” They used electric fencing to keep the herd tight and the wolves outside the perimeter.

“This is not just about dead animals,” says Ulring. “A stressed animal has minimal weight gain or can even lose weight. Our animals, even when they were near that den, they’re gaining more than three pounds a day.” All that extra poundage translates into dollars, allowing the ranch to sell more steaks and burgers.

“These techniques are proactive rather than reactive, so they prevent conflicts from happening in the first place,” says Zack Strong, a wildlife advocate with NRDC. Along with conservation strategies, NRDC helps J Bar L and other ranches purchase equipment and hire range riders (and even lends a hand with the electric fencing).

The approach may very well be a selling point, too. John Marzluff, a University of Washington biologist, is launching a statewide poll to gauge whether people would pay more for predator-friendly beef. “We’re also working with some stores to test-market it,” he told MotherBoard.

<strong>Field tests</strong>

Researcher Azzurra Valerio of the Large Carnivore Conservation Lab at Washington State University says she isn’t surprised to hear of the program’s success. Ranchers taking similar steps elsewhere in the West report fewer losses, too: the Blackfoot Challenge, in northwestern Montana, for instance, has seen a 93 percent drop in grizzly bear conflicts since it started using range riders and other deterrents in 2003. But Valerio cautions that although there are a lot of stories and anecdotes of livestock and predator harmony, “to my knowledge, there are no evaluations of the efficacy of nonlethal methods such as range riders or fences.” She hopes to change that.

Valerio is in the second year of a three-year study that aims to collect hard data; she’s got collars on six wolf packs, eight cattle herds, and one sheep operation, and is working with four range riders and three sheepherders. Valerio is looking at the number of livestock killed and the indirect influences wolves may have on a flock, such as weight loss and reproductive rates. Her findings, however, won’t be in for a few years.

Anderson, too, speaks cautiously about the effort. “There’s a lot of potential,” but it’s still very new, she says. Rather than basing success on the number of cattle killed—or not—by predators, Anderson uses another metric: the number of ranchers who say yes and stick with it. It won’t matter whether the measures work if nobody is willing to take a chance. So far, no one has dropped out.

The Grosse Pointe Academy was once again named a “Michigan Green School,” representing the eighth consecutive year that the school received the designation from the state. GPA was honored for its success in generally raising student awareness and for promoting stewardship of the environment.

According to Academy faculty member Sasha Murphy, who spearheads GPA’s Green School initiative, schools also are rated based on four specific categories: <strong>recycling</strong>, which could include composting food and organic wastes; <strong>energy</strong>, which includes implementing a school energy-saving program; <strong>environmental protection</strong>, which includes establishing or maintaining a natural Michigan garden project with native plants; and <strong>miscellaneous</strong>, which could include establishing a student organization that participates in environmental activities, observing Earth Day, establishing an eco-reading program, and updating the school’s media center environmental materials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Grosse Pointe Academy alum and noted artist is creating painting for the school’s 50th Action Auction.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27669" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg-studio2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27669"><img class="wp-image-27669 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg-studio2_1000px.jpg" alt="meg-studio2_1000px" width="1000" height="545" /></a> Grosse Pointe Academy alum Meg Mercier ('77) is in her studio on Martha's Vineyard.[/caption]

When 1977 Grosse Pointe Academy alum Meg Mercier offered to donate one of her paintings to this year’s <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/support-gpa/action-auction/" target="_blank">Action Auction, the school’s 50th</a>,</strong> organizers were thrilled. But what they didn’t know at that time was that Mercier was going to use her alma mater itself as the inspiration for the painting.

“I am planning the painting for the auction, and I’m actually going to the Academy today to take some pictures for some ideas,” said Mercier in an interview in February. “I want to do something on the Academy for sure, but right now, I’m not quite sure. Might be a scene inside or could be outside.”

Well it turns out that Mercier is now very sure about the painting.

“Just finished a study for the painting,” she said. “I decided my subject was going to be ‘the steps.’”

The “steps,” Mercier said — the ones leading up to the school’s main entrance — are a very big part of her memories of GPA. “It was where we met up at the end of each day with my siblings and waited for our mother. They were like bleacher seats with different groups gathering, plus the big lawn always was the place for a little more play with our friends.

“For me they are a metaphor for learning and growing up,” she said. “As a family, we logged a lot of time on those steps waiting for our old station wagon to pull up. I have many happy memories from back then.

[caption id="attachment_27671" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg_easel_edit2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27671"><img class="wp-image-27671 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg_easel_edit2_1000px.jpg" alt="meg_easel_edit2_1000px" width="1000" height="773" /></a> Mercier has developed a love for working “en plein air," which is painting outside versus in a studio.[/caption]

Back then, Mercier, who was the oldest of five in her immediate family who attended the Academy, said she actually started school on the campus when it was still under the tutelage of nuns.

“I was in the last class of Montessori with the nuns before the school transitioned from the Academy of the Sacred Heart to The Grosse Pointe Academy,” Mercier said. “So we actually were the first class to go from first through eighth grade as part of The Grosse Pointe Academy.”

Mercier also noted that both her grandmothers and her aunts attended the school when it was ASH.

<strong>From Miami of Ohio to Fenway Studios</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27666" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg-studio_300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27666"><img class="wp-image-27666 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/meg-studio_300px.jpg" alt="meg-studio_300px" width="300" height="400" /></a> Mercier currently is artist-in-residence for the Martha's Vineyard Art Association.[/caption]

After Mercier graduated from GPA, she attended Grosse Pointe South High School and graduated in 1981. She then matriculated to Miami University in Ohio as a science major, but a strong desire to follow her creative muse along with summer classes at the Rhode Island School of Design led to a completely new shift in direction.

“It was at RISD when I really decide to give studio art a shot,” she said.

Following her time at RISD, she got involved with the Fenway Studios, which was closely allied with the famed Boston School of painting and known primarily for its American Impressionist style with John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet and Jan Vermeer as major influences. Mercier spent more than 10 years studying in the Fenway Studios.

While studying at Fenway, which featured a roster full of luminaries that included Edmund Tarbell, Frank Benson, William Paxton and R.H. Ives Gammell, Mercier’s formal training came from painter Paul lngbretson. She worked in lngbretson's atelier for most of her ten years at Fenway, and worked on cast drawing, still-life painting, which then graduated for her to figurative study and portrait painting.

It was at that time, also, that Mercier developed a love for painting “en plein air” as she looked to portray the poetry of everyday scenes, capturing moments in the outdoors of sunlight and simple gestures.

Fast-forward to today, Mercier is based primarily on Martha’s Vineyard near Boston (she is currently artist-in-residence for the Martha's Vineyard Art Association), although she gets back to Michigan for a few months each year. She keeps a studio nearby in her brother’s apartment for when she feels the need to create while in Michigan.

“I’m going to be heading back to the Vineyard in May,” she said. “I’m usually at Martha’s Vineyard about eight months of the year, but I plan to be in town for the auction.”

Mercier’s studio on Martha’s Vineyard is in Edgartown Village on the eastern side of the island, which has been a constant source of inspiration for her.

“I am totally captivated by the natural and endless beauty of the Vineyard,” she said. “The sunrise is one my favorite times to paint outside. I love watching the incredible changing sky as the island wakes up.”

<strong>Beauty on many levels</strong>

She plans to donate the artwork to the 50th annual Action Auction, which takes place May 13, 2017.[/caption]

While creating art on Martha’s Vineyard is a long way literally and figuratively from The Grosse Pointe Academy, Mercier said her former school remains near and dear to her heart, especially since it was while she was there that she first realized she might have more than an average talent for art.

But, she said, it was her younger sister who first got noticed as the family artist.

“Mrs. Hall, our GPA art teacher, told my mother that my sister Nell was showing extraordinary talent and that she should take some private art classes,” Mercier said. “But she was too shy to attend on her own, so I accompanied her to the classes and eventually took art lessons with Nell and soon began to get noticed myself. We were both so very young.”

Mercier says that even as a very young student at the Academy, she appreciated the breathtaking campus that surrounded her and her classmates.

“Going to school at such a beautiful place was special for me,” she said. “To be surrounded by such beauty, including the nature around the grounds and the architecture of the building. Plus, the spiritual beauty of the chapel, all of which I never, ever took for granted.”

<strong>More on Meg Mercier:</strong>
In addition to the Fenway Studios, Mercier studied with landscape painter John Osborne of the Ridgewood Institute and with Robert Douglas Hunter, another student of Ives Gammell. She spent a summer painting in Giverny, France, through the patronage of the late Ambassador Daniel J. Terra and his wife Judith. The Terras are founders of the Musée Americain Giverny, and owners of the former home and studio of Boston painter Lilla Cabot Perry on a unique property in France adjacent to Claude Monet's original home and gardens.

A member of the Copley Society of Artists, the oldest art association in America, Mercier was recognized in 1993 with the prestigious "Excellence in Painting" award. She also is a member of the Catherine Lorillard Wolfe Club, the Allied Artists of America, and the American Society of Portrait Artists.

In addition, the National Arts Club, the Salmagundi Club, the Springfield Museum, and the Parkman House of Boston are among the many places her work has been exhibited. Some of Mercier’s awards include a Third Place at the 1998 Grand Exhibition of Ohio/Akron Artists' Society, an Honorable Mention at the 1998 Springfield Realism Society, and First Place at the 1999 Duxbury Art Association.

More recently, a painting by Mercier was acquired by and will be displayed at the Carnegie Mellon Museum of Martha's Vineyard. She also was selected by the Art Committee of the Union League Club of NYC to do a solo exhibition at the club next December, and she and her sister Nell are collaborating on a joint show this July at the North Water Gallery on Martha’s Vineyard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Patti Smith performed in March at the Royal Oak Music Theatre, donates memorabilia to her children’s former school for its annual auction.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PS_live_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27695"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27695" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PS_live_1000px.jpg" alt="ps_live_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /></a>

Legendary singer-songwriter, poet, author and visual artist Patti Smith returned to metro Detroit in March to perform at the Royal Oak Music Theatre as part of a series of special shows centered around her seminal debut album, “Horses,” which was released in 1975.

The March 11 show honored the longevity and lasting influence of the album on the third stop of a tour that also takes her to Australia and Europe.

“It will be a true, proud celebration,” Smith said ahead of the concert of her intent to perform Horses in its entirety. She was accompanied by two members of her original group, Lenny Kaye and Jay Dee Daugherty, along with bassist/keyboardist Tony Shanahan, who has been a part of her band for twenty years.

Smith recently donated a number of memorabilia items to The Grosse Pointe Academy’s May 13 Annual Action Auction, which raises money for the independent, private school located on the shores of Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe Farms.

Jesse and her brother, Jackson, attended The Grosse Pointe Academy.[/caption]

Born in Chicago and raised in New Jersey, Smith married guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith from the Detroit rock band MC5 in 1980 and lived with her husband and their two kids, Jackson Smith and Jesse Paris Smith, in St. Clair Shores, Mich., for more than 15 years. It was during this time in Michigan when both Jackson and Jesse attended the Academy.

Jesse Paris Smith, an accomplished musician and composer in her own right, recalled her time at GPA fondly.

[caption id="attachment_27690" align="alignright" width="250"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jesse-edit_250px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27690"><img class="wp-image-27690 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jesse-edit_250px.jpg" alt="jesse-edit_250px" width="250" height="366" /></a> Jesse Paris Smith in one of her official Academy school photos.[/caption]

“What I learned and experienced at the Academy created such an important foundation for the years that followed, and so many things I learned have stayed with me, and have probably influenced me in ways I’m not even aware of yet,” she said. “This includes what I learned in the classroom, interacting with the other students, and just being in those incredible buildings and on the grounds of the school.”

Among the items donated by Patti Smith to the Academy’s auction are first-edition hardcover books, “Just Kids” and “M Train,” signed by author Smith along with audio-book versions of both best-sellers.

In addition, posters from recent live concert events surrounding Pathway to Paris, Jesse's non-profit initiative to raise awareness and funds for climate change, were donated, two of which are signed by the performers and speakers, including Patti Smith, Jesse Paris Smith, Lenny Kaye, Suzzy Roche, Anne Waldman, Michael Stipe of REM, Patrick Watson, Jonathan Donahue and Grasshopper of Mercury Rev, and Martha Wainwright.

Kristen Van Pelt, who is the Academy’s development director and manages the auction, says the school is delighted by the items from Smith.

“We are most grateful that Patti Smith and her family have contributed such interesting memorabilia to our auction,” said Van Pelt. “It will join so many other exciting items, trips and services that will be auctioned off on May 13.”

Van Pelt also noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the event.

“In keeping with tradition, this year’s celebration will offer fabulous items, trips, and experiences,” she said. “But it will also capture the long and storied history of this fantastic event. Our auction is one of the premier school gala events in the country and is renowned for its success year after year.”

Van Pelt said the evening will consist of a silent auction, seated dinner, a live auction, and special afterglow.

“Also, we are excited to announce and welcome charity auctioneer Mark Schroeder of Auction Brio to our auction,” she added.

“We hope many will join us for this anniversary event as it is sure to be a fabulous night.”

Grosse Pointe Academy 7th-graders Ava Said and Bode Neumeister earned first-place trophies yesterday in the 2017 Chinese Zodiac Art Contest, an annual competition sponsored by the Confucius Institute of Wayne State University.

Said received first-place in the “3D category” for her piece she called “The Fire Rooster Bowl,” which was designed to depict this year’s Chinese Zodiac animal, the rooster. Said also collaborated with Neumeister on a first-place design in the “T-shirt” category of the contest.

In addition, 6th-grader Neil Murphy won a 3rd-place trophy for his 3D project called, "A Rooster's Fortune."  Five other Academy students competed in the competition last night. They are 6th-graders Robert Peabody, Alexander Kuplicki and Shayla Andrews; and 8th-graders Emmanuelle Cubba and Gordon Acheson.

The Confucius Institute is located within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wayne State University. Its mission is to provide and support Chinese language and cultural programs for K-12 schools, the university community and professional communities in southeastern Michigan.

Erin Brott, who teaches art at the Academy, noted that Said first heard about the competition in Shanyi Chen’s Mandarin Chinese class.

“Ava worked with me on a number of days after school on making her ceramic rooster bowl come to life,” Brott said. “She is a very creative and talented young lady who puts a lot of time into planning the details and execution of her designs.”

“Out of nearly 100 art pieces entered into the competition this year, our students brought home three trophies: two first-place trophies and one third-place trophy,” said Chen, who teaches Mandarin Chinese to Academy 5th through 8th graders. Chen said the winner and participation certificates for all of the GPA students who submitted artwork will be presented after spring break. Plus, student artwork will be on display outside her classroom for open house next Wednesday.

Said’s winning art was based on this year’s Zodiak animal and the fact that the number “7” (in 2017) is considered lucky. The fired ceramic rooster featured the colors gold, brown and yellow and the number 7, which she represented with the number of combs on the rooster’s head.

“Ava tried to make the spirit of the rooster’s personality come through in her work by rendering in a trustworthy and sincere expression on the rooster’s face,” Brott added. “The judges obviously thought she was successful in that regard. She really is an exceptional talent.”

Chen said that besides the theme of the zodiac animal, competition rules stated that all of the art pieces must depict four Chinese characters, have beautiful colors and design as well as fine art technology. "Plus," she said, "the each entry submitted must be generally enjoyable and appreciated as a whole piece of art to audiences."

Chen also noted said she is working to set up a team of GPA students for the Confucius Institute’s Chinese Quiz Bowl, which will be held next Saturday, Mar. 18.

Grosse Pointe Academy alum David Scupholm (’13), currently a senior at Grosse Pointe South High School, recently earned a state championship from a prestigious competition held last weekend in downtown Detroit. The Michigan chapter of DECA, or Distributive Education Clubs of America, is an association of students in the state who are planning careers in marketing, management and entrepreneurship. DECA holds annual conferences and competitions throughout Michigan with the finals typically hosted in Detroit. Next year's conference finals are scheduled for March 9-11, 2018.

Scupholm won his state title in the “Business Services - Marketing” event, which pitted him against hundreds of other high schoolers at Detroit’s Cobo Center on examinations and presentations that highlight a detailed business plan. Students were challenged to perform marketing functions and tasks involved in providing services to businesses on a fee or contract basis or providing services to consumers.

The criteria for Scupholm's competition category at DECA included understanding the tools, techniques, and systems that businesses use to create exchanges and satisfy organizational objectives; understanding marketing's role and function in business to facilitate economic exchanges with customers; and explaining marketing’s importance to the global economy.

Scupholm, who will graduate from South in May, also was recently named a finalist in the latest edition of the National Merit Scholarship competition, making him eligible for one of the 7,500 National Merit Scholarships worth nearly $33 million that will be offered nationwide to the Class of 2017. He plans to major in business or pre-law in college and is anxiously awaiting to hear in the next few weeks from a number of colleges and universities to which he has applied.

Congratulations and good luck, David!

Yesterday in the Manoogian Hall of Wayne State University next to the school’s Confucius Institute, Grosse Pointe Academy 7th-graders Bode Neumeister and Ava Said earned a first place in Middle School Division 1 at the 9th Annual Michigan China Quiz Bowl.

Sponsored by the Confucius Institute, the Quiz Bowl tested more than 100 students from 10 middle and high schools Saturday on their knowledge of Chinese language and geography.

According to Academy Mandarin Chinese teacher Shanyi Chen, the two GPA students competed as a real team with each bringing their own expertise to the event.

“Bode was very good and talented on recognizing Chinese characters and speaking sentences in Chinese,” Chen said. “To prepare for this, he even created his own flashcards and used them to study when he had free time. And Ava answered geography questions and spoke in sentences with typical, daily expressions in Chinese.”

Those competing yesterday went through three rounds with each round having 25 questions containing Chinese characters along with spoken sentences that included translations and geography.

According to the Confucius Institute, Chinese native and heritage students (those who are from homes where Chinese may be spoken) and students who have spent more than 30 days in China are ineligible to participate in the competition, but are encouraged to volunteer as score keepers, time keepers, and score sheet runners.

“Congratulations to Bode and Ava on their big accomplishment,” Chen said. “Each student is unique and has their own talent, but their teamwork is what really made the difference yesterday.”

Emily Spica, a 2007 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, was recently accepted into the University of Pennsylvania’s veterinary medicine program, which is ranked one of the top 10 veterinary programs in the country.

Spica, who was president of her class at GPA, attended the Interlochen Arts Academy and recently graduated from Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. She begins at Penn in the fall in a very selective veterinary school in a highly competitive field. In fact, only about 10% of applicants are accepted into the program on an annual basis.

<strong>More on Penn Vet:</strong>
The School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania was founded in 1884, and has a long-standing tradition as a global leader in veterinary medicine education, research, and clinical care, with a tradition of compassionate clinical expertise, intellectual rigor and the pursuit of innovative thinking.

In a recent article published by the Delaware News Journal, two educators discuss how (and why) some administrators in Delaware and around the country are bringing the Montessori approach to education into their district public schools — albeit still a relatively rare phenomenon.

Like many other private, independent schools, The Grosse Pointe Academy has been far ahead of the curve in recognizing the value of Montessori. In fact, the Academy is home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program. Find out more about <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/academics/montessori-early-school-cultivating-a-desire-to-learn/" target="_blank">GPA’s Early School Montessori program <strong>here</strong></a>.

In making their point in the article republished below, educators Christine Carrino Gorowara and Linda Zankowsky also point out that Montessori is “exactly” the educational program most parents would design as ideal for their own children.

<strong>Montessori schooling is the educational experience that many parents would create for their own</strong>

What kind of school would you choose for your children? Most parents would agree: one that could focus on their individual needs, one that fostered their independence and self-direction, encourages their unique interest and helps them develop necessary academic skills.

For over 100 years, Montessori education has provided this kind of schooling to millions of children in the United States and around the world. For most of its history, Montessori has been available almost exclusively through private schools, but in recent years there has been a growing movement to bring the benefits of a Montessori education to all children by offering it in public schools. The National Center for Montessori in the Public Sector reports that there are now over 500 public Montessori schools in the United States.

[caption id="attachment_27800" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bd4a0225_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27800"><img class="wp-image-27800 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bd4a0225_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a0225_1000px" width="1000" height="741" /></a> Students at The Grosse Pointe Academy begin their educational journey in the nurturing environment of the Academy’s Early School, the longest continuously operating Montessori program in Michigan. Dr. Maria Montessori’s philosophy advocates the belief that early childhood education should cultivate a child’s desire to learn.[/caption]

Montessori Works has supported public Montessori education in Delaware since 2012, helping to start the Montessori Academy at Christina, advocating for First State Montessori Academy in Wilmington, and sponsoring a charter application for Sussex Montessori School with expectations of a Fall 2019 opening. Additionally, the organization is working with partners to create a pipeline of teachers who are both Montessori-trained and state certified.

Why Montessori? Simply put, Montessori schooling is exactly the educational experience that many parents would create for their children. This is by design, Maria Montessori based her method on observations of children and how they interacted with their environment. Accordingly, Montessori educators prepare their classrooms so children can select materials that stimulate learning appropriate to their levels of development. When children are able to choose activities, they are more interested in their schoolwork, which results in more effective learning. They also develop the important skills of independent learning and time management.

Montessori education also features multi-aged groupings, guided by two educators in each classroom. This allows children to engage in the work most appropriate for their abilities and interests. They may work individually, although they more commonly work in pairs or small groups that provide opportunities for student-to-student discussions. Because the students typically remain in the same classroom for 2-3 years, older children are able to develop into mentors to younger children, which strengthens the learning experience for both.

So why isn’t the Montessori method more widespread? One of the main reasons is the lack of familiarity with Montessori education. When Montessori Works conducted an interest study, parents responded enthusiastically to individual features of Montessori education, including personalized learning, the opportunity to learn with and from peers, the development of real life skills, the support of innovative thinking, the value of global citizenship, and the focus on the whole child. What the parents too often didn’t know, however, is that Montessori brings all of these features together, or that Montessori can be a public school option.

Montessori Works applauds Christina School District Interim Superintendent Noreen LaSorsa and the Christina School Board for their support of Montessori Academy at Christina (MAC), despite some rocky transition issues that have resulted in a recent drop in enrollment. The early success of MAC and the long waiting list at First State Montessori Academy demonstrate the strong interest in public Montessori education in New Castle County. And as Montessori Works builds greater awareness downstate, more and more Delaware parents want for Montessori education for their children.

Every child deserves an opportunity to learn in a stimulating, collaborative, and innovative community. Delaware public schools can provide that opportunity through Montessori education. The key is for parents to ask for it.

[caption id="attachment_27815" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Harley_Ensign_March-2017_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27815"><img class="wp-image-27815 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Harley_Ensign_March-2017_1000px.jpg" alt="harley_ensign_march-2017_1000px" width="1000" height="672" /></a> Academy teacher Michelle Roberts and three 8th graders, center, joined other volunteers yesterday for a Clinton River "cleanup."[/caption]

Every Wednesday morning from 10 a.m. until noon, the Clinton River Watershed Council (CRWC) hosts a “cleanup” somewhere along the Clinton River Watershed, which stretches across more than 700 miles in four counties and 72 communities in southeast Michigan.

Yesterday, Michelle Roberts, a math and science teacher of 6th-8th graders at The Grosse Pointe Academy, took three environmentally minded 8th graders to the Harley Ensign DNR Memorial Boat Launch in Harrison Township to help clean up the portion of the Clinton River that empties into Lake St. Clair at that location.

“I found this opportunity when I was doing some research for GPA's annual Green School recertification,” said Roberts, who has worked with fellow faculty member Sasha Murphy on the Green School initiative for a number of years.

Roberts said that the cleanup was an opportunity she offered to 8th graders as part of their community-service requirements. She said that Academy students Julia Hartnett, Alexandria Belyue and Prosperity Dickerson jumped at the chance, even though it was a day off from school.

And since it was the first time she organized such an effort from GPA, Roberts wasn’t quite sure what to expect.

“I had no idea what we would face, but I told the girls it would most certainly be an adventure,” she said. “We were lucky, as the weather worked out, and we had a beautiful day to be outside. One of the girls actually said afterward that the cleanup could be an annual event, which is a great idea. But I told this group that they will be recorded as the first group ever from GPA to do this.”

As one can imagine, picking up trash along a very public waterway could produce some intriguing, and yes, even some scary finds, but Roberts said it wasn’t too bad yesterday.

“We picked up some interesting items to be sure,” she said. “A sweatshirt, one tennis shoe, but no flip-flips. Also, some dead fish, which will give us something to talk about in class on why there may have been so many of them.”

One-hundred-ten years ago this week, education innovator Maria Montessori opened her second "Casa dei Bambini," or Children’s House, in Rome to educate more than 50 children between the ages of two and six in what was becoming an increasingly popular academic pedagogy.

By the end of 1911, Montessori education had been officially adopted in public schools in both Italy and Switzerland. By 1912, Montessori schools had opened in Paris and many other Western European cities, and were planned for Argentina, Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, Syria, the United States and New Zealand. In addition, public programs in London, Johannesburg, Rome and Stockholm had adopted the method in their school systems.

The first United States Montessori school was opened in October 1911, in Tarrytown, New York. Shortly thereafter, inventor Alexander Graham Bell and his wife became proponents of the Montessori method and opened the first Canadian Montessori school near their home in Ontario.

Today, there are more than 4,500 Montessori schools in the United States and about 20,000 worldwide.

The Grosse Pointe Academy, which is home to Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program, is pleased to offer four quotes from Maria Montessori, founder of the Montessori method, arguably the world’s most innovative education philosophy. Enjoy!

"My vision of the future is no longer of people taking exams and proceeding from secondary school to University but of passing from one stage of independence to a higher, by means of their own activity and effort of will." <strong>(From Childhood to Adolescence — 1948, opening)</strong>

“We recognize the immense power, the unconscious forces existing in the child on the threshold of life. For many years we have been proclaiming that it is necessary to educate the child from the moment of birth. We have traced, through study and practical experience, the ideal path leading to the world of children, of these beings whose social status has as yet not been determined, whose rights have not been recognized and who nevertheless represent the men of tomorrow.” <strong>(From the San Remo Lectures — 1949)</strong>

"We then found that individual activity is the one factor that stimulates and produces development, and that this is not more true for the little ones of preschool age than it is for the junior, middle, and upper school children." <strong>(From The Absorbent Mind — 1949, p. 7)</strong>

"All the social and moral habits that shape a man’s personality. . .are formed during infancy, in virtue of that mysterious mental power that psychologists have called ‘Mneme.’”<strong> (From The Absorbent Mind — 1949, p. 59)</strong>

Director: Ken Brubaker (Coach B)
The 313 Lacrosse Summer Camps at The Grosse Pointe Academy is a unique training experience for players looking to learn fundamental techniques and skills through concentrated training on the field. We welcome players of all skill levels to the 313 Lax Camps. Players will be separated by experience, size and/or skill level.

At 313, we believe player development is possibly the most important and least emphasized element of the game.

The 313 staff consists of collegiate-level instructors who will be assisted by local high school varsity players. Our camps will use proven 313 modern training methods to train all players. Grosse Pointe resident and founder Ken “Coach B” Brubaker has formulated a fun and effective player-improvement system as a result of training players and coaching lacrosse at all levels for more than a decade.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Special ring’s journey to auction began with master jeweler’s sketch.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27905" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/stone_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27905"><img class="wp-image-27905 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/stone_1000px.jpg" alt="stone_1000px" width="1000" height="919" /></a> The 10.17-carat aquamarine stone will be set into a special ring designed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of The Grosse Pointe Academy's Action Auction.[/caption]

When the live bidding begins at The Grosse Pointe Academy’s <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/support-gpa/action-auction/" target="_blank">50th Annual Action Auction</a></strong> on May 13 in the school’s Tracy Fieldhouse, one item in particular will hold a special place for both the Academy and one of its longtime patrons and donors, Edmund T. Ahee Jewelers.

That’s because both Ahee Jewelers and the Action Auction are celebrating milestones in 2017: 70 years in business for Ahee and 50 years of auctions for the Academy.

John Ahee is vice president of Grosse Pointe Woods-based Ahee Jewelers, one of Metro Detroit’s most prestigious and philanthropic businesses. He said because it’s such a special year for both Ahee and GPA, he thought it was time to custom design and manufacture a special piece of jewelry: an aquamarine and diamond cocktail ring.

[caption id="attachment_27904" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sketch_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27904"><img class="wp-image-27904 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sketch_1000px.jpg" alt="sketch_1000px" width="1000" height="771" /></a> Master jeweler and designer Chris Ahee sketched out the aquamarine and diamond cocktail ring, which will take center stage at the Academy's auction on May 13.[/caption]

“The ring for the auction was custom-designed by my brother, Chris Ahee, who is a multi-award winning designer of jewelry,” John said. “It features an excellent quality 10+ carat aquamarine stone set in an entirely custom 18-karat white gold ring surrounded by 50 (for the auction’s 50th anniversary) very fine quality round-brilliant and princess-cut diamonds.”

John Ahee said his brother, with the help of sister, Pam, began conceptualizing the ring at the start of the year. After several renditions, they came up with the final design. Then Chris traveled across the country to Tucson, Arizona, to find the perfect centerpiece aquamarine stone cut originally by one of the best stone cutters from Germany.

John said they’ve got something else quite special planned for the night of GPA’s auction.

“One of our master jewelers, Brett Mitchell, will put his finishing touches on the ring at the event,” he said. “We are transporting his entire bench and tools to the Academy that evening. Also, we are creating a special hardcover book showing the making of this ring — from drawing board to stone-setting - which will be presented along with the ring to the highest bidder.”

Ahee noted that his company and family have a long-standing relationship with The Grosse Pointe Academy. He said several of his nieces and nephews have attended the Academy and he always looks forward to helping out whenever and wherever possible. But it’s the auction that gets the Ahee family especially excited because of how much it benefits the school.

“It is truly an honor to be involved with this prestigious event,” he said. “We’ve been participating in the auction for nearly 40 years. The Grosse Pointe Academy is a special icon in our community and one of the preeminent intuitions in our region.”

Ahee Jewelers also created 1-1/2” diameter hoop earrings for the auction that feature 7.5 total carats of diamond stones set in 18-karat white gold.

Kristen Van Pelt, the Academy’s director of development, said the school is beyond delighted with Ahee’s longtime commitment to the auction.

"The Grosse Pointe Academy has always felt blessed to have a community partner like Ahee Jewelers,” she said. “They continually support our auction with beautiful fine jewelry, but this year takes the cake! John Ahee really stepped up to make this ring not just a lovely piece, but to also make it a special live auction ‘happening.’”

		<title>Full-time school nurse a rare benefit in Michigan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<center><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rosemary_B_1200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28014"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28014" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rosemary_B_1200px.jpg" alt="rosemary_b_1200px" width="1200" height="384" /></a></center>According to national statistics, Michigan ranks last among states in the ratio of school nurses to students. This alarming statistic raises concerns about the safety of students, says a report from the Michigan Department of Community Health and Michigan Department of Education.

In the Rochester, Michigan, school district, for example, one nurse is responsible for more than 15,000 students in 23 buildings.

Fortunately, students at The Grosse Pointe Academy have among many other benefits the services of Rosemary Barker, R.N., the school’s full-time licensed nurse since 2010. According to school records, GPA has had a nurse on staff for many years.

Most if not all school administrators would agree that students nationwide require the kind of medical attention and oversight that those at a school like the Academy get on an all-day, every-day basis.

Healthy nurse-to-student ratios ensure each child is afforded appropriate preventative, health-promotion, early identification and intervention services, the state report said. “There is a critical link between health and wellness and academic success. Improving school nurse-to-student ratios can decrease student absenteeism, increase graduation rates, and remove health-related barriers to learning.”

Barker couldn’t agree more.

“Schools need nurses, plain and simple” she said. “Other schools in the state are in serious trouble in this area. With the increase in the number of diabetics, asthmatics, and kids with food allergies, there is a critical need for more school nurses.

“Fortunately, students at GPA are getting such care,” she added.

<strong>Part of the GPA family</strong>

Barker’s tenure at GPA goes back a lot farther than when she became the full-time school nurse. She started at the Academy as a parent in 1987 (her three children attended GPA) and has had many volunteer roles there, including room mom, PCC chair/board member, and Action Auction finance chair. She started subbing as school nurse in 1996 before taking it on full-time five years ago. Barker also coached intramurals and has chaperoned many a class trip.

She says she’s always enjoyed being a part of the GPA family.

“Every year when I come back to campus in the fall, it is like coming home,” she said. “People have always been so welcoming here and take a real personal interest in each other. I also feel working at GPA is a way to give back to the school for the education my three children received here.”

<strong>Nurse and teacher</strong>

Among many favorite parts of her job, Barker, who earned her nursing degree from the University of Michigan, says she really enjoys the primary-care aspect. But, she said, it’s also the teaching part of the job that makes it all worthwhile.

“I like the fact that one day I could be teaching a new asthmatic how to use an inhaler properly, and the next day I’m teaching students with allergies the necessary resources to help them deal with food restrictions,” she said. “I also spend a lot of time teaching the kids how to read food labels and giving parents all the necessary resources they need for proper medical attention at home.”

Barker’s medical career has not always been in a school setting, though. Before hiring on full time at GPA, she was a nurse specializing in oncology, neurology and OB/GYN, and she also taught childbirth classes. A busy career, for sure.

But now she is working on slowly reducing the amount of “outside—of-school” activities in her life. Her children are grown-ups themselves now and she and her husband, David, are looking forward to being grandparents in October. She's retired from 27 years of volunteering for the Boy Scouts and is trying to learn how to relax.

“We now enjoy getting together more often with family and friends,” she said. “And I am rediscovering this thing called weekends.”

<strong>Academy alum is helping to bring clean water to impoverished nations</strong>

An Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in early 2015 concluded that, against a common perception that today’s younger generation—millennials—are self-absorbed, apathetic and tuned out to the world at large, they are in fact as tuned in or even more tuned in than the generation that preceded them.

Indeed, the poll found there actually was an increase in young Americans who say that citizens have a very important obligation to participate in community service, whether on a voluntary basis or not.

And according to data from the Corporation for National and Community Service, 20% of adults 30 and under said they’ve worked or volunteered for the betterment of their community, up from 14% in 1989.

Against that background, we contacted Natalie Relich, a 2001 graduate of The Grosse Pointe Academy, who already has devoted a significant portion of her 28-year-old life to making the world a better place for its citizens.

Relich currently is executive director of the OHorizons Foundation, a nonprofit based in New York City, that is working to improve the health, livelihood, and productivity of hungry and thirsty people around the world.

A public policy major at the University of Michigan, Relich finished her university career at NYU with a master’s degree in public administration. She said she decided to get an MPA in New York because she’s always wanted to go into the field of international development and New York seemed like a great place to study this since it’s home to many development and internationally focused organizations.

But even though in college she considered public policy likely her life’s calling, it wasn’t until Relich did more of her own research on a particularly troubling environmental issue on the planet that she eventually jumped in with both feet to try to affect real change for people—specifically for people suffering from a lack of clean water and sanitation.

<strong>Simple solution</strong>

“Around the world, a child dies about every thirty seconds from diarrhea,” Relich said, “And it’s typically caused by lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation. To help combat this, my organization, OHorizons, works with concrete ‘biosand filters’ (BSFs), which are water-filtration devices for household use in developing countries such as Bangladesh and Mali.”

<em><strong>Photo: GPA alum Natalie Relich ('01), far right, in Bangladesh after building molds to be used for special water-filtration devices.</strong></em>

She said the BSF is a relatively simple solution—"We call it a low-tech, high-thinking solution"—perfect for areas of the world without many resources for more expensive, conventional water treatment.

“The body of the filter is made out of concrete and inside it has sand and gravel that filter out pathogens in the water,” she said. “Basically, it filters water the same way natural groundwater filtration works, using gravity and no complicated or expensive parts, making it ideal for remote, poor communities.”

Concrete BSFs originally were invented by a Canadian professor in the 90s, and were traditionally cast in a steel mold in which concrete is poured and cured. Relich said the steel molds are heavy, expensive, and typically require a skilled and experienced welder, which can be quite difficult to find in rural, impoverished parts of the world.

“So my organization invented a wood mold as a very low-cost alternative to the steel molds,” she said  “It makes the same BSF, but at a fraction of the cost and weight and anyone can make it—even with very little or no construction experience. In fact, all of our technical materials are open-source on our website and available to anybody anywhere to download.”<img style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151020095934.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

<em><strong>Photo: Relich, left, is helping Bangladeshis make molds that will be used for special water-filtration devices.</strong></em>

In 2014, OHorizons did pilot programs with these inexpensive BSFs in Bangladesh, Ecuador and Mali, which went very well, according to Relich, ultimately providing nearly 1,200 people with clean water. “Next year, we will be expanding our work even further in Bangladesh through a local partner, ultimately bringing clean water to 10,000 people,” she said. “We're also trying to forge new partnerships in other countries to expand our impact.”

<strong>From yellow cabs to rickshaws</strong>

Relich acknowledges that while it’s truly worth it when you see the fruits of their labor, the work she and her crew does is not without stress.

“The areas where we go typically are pretty remote,” she said. “For example, to get to where we were working in Bangladesh, I had to fly into Dhaka, the country’s capital, take a short flight to another city within Bangladesh, take a five-hour car ride, and then a short motorcycle ride to get to my hotel since the roads were very narrow and cars couldn't get there. We had to take a rickshaw to our partner's office everyday and didn't see cars for several days at a time. It really puts things into perspective when you see how other people live—away from bustling and noisy cities, cars, taxi cabs, and a lot of things that we consider part of our daily lives, such as television, high-speed Internet, smartphones, air conditioning, clean, running water, and electricity that always works.”

While it appears the Brooklyn-resident Relich was destined for the work she’s now doing, she admits it took her awhile to figure out her exact path and how specifically she wanted to focus her career. And how it will develop going forward.

<img style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/resources/img/file-20151020100016.jpg" alt="" border="0" />

<em><strong>Photo: Ecuadorians are shown building special molds designed by Relich and her company, OHorizons.</strong></em>

“I have always considered helping people and trying, even if in a small way, to make the world a better place to be my life's work,” she said. “But while I don't know if I will always be working for a nonprofit or in the water space, I think the kind of work I'm doing now, empowering people to improve their lives and working with poor, marginalized communities, will always be something that I am passionate about and will continue to do for years to come.”

<strong>Singing the U.S. presidents</strong>

Relich’s interest in public policy and service to the community actually began to form at the Academy.

“I had a lot of memorable teachers at GPA, but Mrs. (Mary Jo) Johnson, my middle-school social studies teacher, stands out,” Relich said. “She, to this day, is one of the best teachers I've ever had, and I've been fortunate to have some truly inspiring teachers in my life. She was tough, but she so obviously loved her job and the subject she was teaching. I still remember various facts and dates she taught us during the American Revolution section of class. And it was her class that ultimately got me interested in government and history and set me on this path of studying public policy in college and getting me where I am today.”

So while Relich, whose three brothers also attended GPA, is more than 14 years removed from the Academy, there are many, many more GPA memories still there for the asking.

“So many,” she said. “And the older I get, the more affinity I have for the Academy as I realize how important and formative my time there was.

“I vividly recall our 8th-grade trip to France and Spain and the 8th-grade play,” she said. “Being able to travel to Europe at a young age is a fairly rare experience, and now that I've had the chance to travel to other parts of the world (about 15 countries and counting), I realize how unique that experience was. Also, the 8th grade play with music teacher Mrs. (Marion) Chrisner was a total blast—we did a mix of scenes from the Wiz and the Wizard of Oz.”

Relich said she’s really an awful singer, dancer, actor—“actually anything to do with the arts,” she said, “but having the space and responsibility to be a part of something creative at the Academy was really special for me.

“Also, thanks to Mrs. Chrisner I can (shockingly) still sing the U.S. presidents in chronological order and the states and their capitals in alphabetical order,” she added. “I also went on a few of science teacher Mr. (Michael) Fultz's summer trips, which were a ton of fun. I still enjoy going camping and hiking around New York whenever I get the chance.”

But it wasn’t always fun and games at the Academy, Relich is quick to point out.

“I definitely think the Academy helped prepare me academically for high school and even for college in that I developed good study habits and an academic discipline that continued to serve me throughout my years as a student after the Academy.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Discussion to focus on ways to motivate young students to own their education and develop resilience.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lahey-doorway_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27921"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27921" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lahey-doorway_1000px.jpg" alt="lahey-doorway_1000px" width="1000" height="668" /></a>

Research has shown that the key to a successful academic strategy is intrinsic motivation — or motivation that comes from within. Educator, writer, and speaker Jessica Lahey will discuss the current research on autonomy-supportive parenting and teaching as well as student competence, rewards, praise — and most importantly, failure — when she visits The Grosse Pointe Academy tonight.

Lahey is the speaker for the latest edition of the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series, and she plans to address those issues and more on tonight at 7 p.m. at the school’s Grosse Pointe Farms campus. Lahey originally was scheduled to speak at GPA in November, but her appearance was postponed due to an area power failure.

In this unique event for parents of school-age children, Lahey, who is the author of the New York Times bestselling book, <em>The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed</em>, will offer parents, teachers, administrators, and guidance counselors practical advice for fostering intrinsic motivation and weaning kids off of extrinsic motivators such as short-term rewards, bribes, honors, coercion, and yes, even grades, while giving kids the support and encouragement they need in order to succeed.

When Lahey is not out on the speaking circuit, she is an English and writing teacher, correspondent for <em>The Atlantic</em>, commentator for Vermont Public Radio, and writes the "Parent-Teacher Conference" column for the <em>New York Times</em>. She earned a B.A. in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and a J.D. with a concentration in juvenile and education law from the University of North Carolina School of Law. She lives in New Hampshire with her husband and two sons.

In an interview with The Grosse Pointe Academy, <a href="http://www.jessicalahey.com" target="_blank">Lahey</a> answered a few questions and discussed what led to her best-selling book.

<strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy: </strong>To which constituency do you most enjoy speaking? Parents, teachers or students?

<strong>Jessica Lahey:</strong> That’s a tough one, as they are so different. I love talking to the students, of course. I would not be a teacher if I did not. They are challenging in their own special way, and it’s more tiring to talk to kids because my energy has to be so high, and I have to be ready to turn on a dime if I begin to lose them. On the other hand, their energy can be amazing when they are engaged, and when they get talking, I remember why I’m doing all of this. I want kids to feel heard, and safe, and supported, and if I can be a part of that, I’m about as happy as I can be.

Speaking to teachers is tough because I know from personal experience what a drag professional development sessions can be, and how resentful I can get when I’m required to go to pointless or stupid workshops. I live in fear of boring teachers or wasting their precious time, so I tend to tailor my content to meet their specific needs and interests. Consequently, I think my sessions with teachers make me more nervous than any other sessions!

I spend most of my time in front of parents, and frankly, that’s really fun. I’m a parent, and I wrote <em>The Gift of Failure</em> because I needed that book to answer the questions I had as a parent. I’m simply sharing what I learned over a couple of years of research, then framing it in terms of education. That’s fun for me.

<strong>GPA: </strong>Obviously, “failure” and how it is addressed are important for a young person’s ultimate success in your latest book. How do you tie this failure in the learning environment to a student’s success?

<strong>Lahey:</strong> <em>The Gift of Failure</em> is my first book, but I’ve been writing about education and parenting for <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The New York Times</em> and Vermont Public Radio for years. The book arose out of a realization that my students - and my own kids - were afraid of failure and certainly did not view it as a part of learning. That was short-circuiting their ability to learn and their very enjoyment of the process. I wanted to understand how failure and resilience and learning intersect, and it turns out that deep mastery simply doesn’t happen unless kids are engaged on an intellectual and emotional level with what they are learning.

<strong>GPA: </strong>Any new books in the works?

<strong>Lahey:</strong> Yes, but not that I’m ready to talk about right now. It really takes a while for books to percolate, and I’m knee-deep in research for this next one.

<strong>About the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series</strong>
William Charles McMillan III was a student at The Grosse Pointe Academy from 1973 until 1981 where, receiving love and encouragement, he learned to reach beyond his limitations. Although weak physically, McMillan was intellectually gifted and his passion for life, his love and concern for all living things, and his enthusiastic use of verbal skills changed the lives of those who were closest to him and left a lasting impression on all with whom he came in contact. Never at a loss for words, McMillan was bursting with impressions, questions and insights which came pouring out in a dazzling, dizzying torrent. It was rare to have a brief, superficial conversation with McMillan. A friend commented, “I sometimes felt like I needed a seat belt when William was talking to me, because he would take us into outer space, back into primeval history, and then into a universe of his own imagining.

"McMillan believed that anyone could make a significant and lasting impact on the world no matter what one’s age, size or circumstance."

The William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series focuses on elementary education and is dedicated to the proposition that every child can reach beyond his or her own limitation, that each child makes the world a better place. It is the goal of these lectures to take your mind where it has never been before.

		<title>An ‘early’ focus on world language</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy’s world language program begins in Early School for students as young as 2-1/2 years old.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27636" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/montessori_talk_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27636"><img class="wp-image-27636 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/montessori_talk_1000px.jpg" alt="montessori_talk_1000px" width="1000" height="716" /></a> The Grosse Pointe Academy's Early School world language program allows children to understand very early that there are other languages spoken by people who share their world.[/caption]

According to Harry T. Chugani, M.D., chief of the Division of Pediatric Neurology at Children’s Hospital of Michigan, children begin to lose their innate ability to learn a second language around the age of ten. His theory is reinforced by Dr. Susan Curtiss, professor of linguistics at UCLA, who says, “The power to learn language is so great in the young child that it doesn’t seem to matter how many languages you throw in their way. . . They can learn as many spoken languages as you can allow them to hear.”

Geoffrey Willans, the late English author and journalist, once said, "You can never understand one language until you understand at least two.”

Perhaps taking Willans’ advice, in 2014, Michael Gove, England’s minister of education, put into place a compulsory program for children up to 11 years old to learn a world language. The rationale was self-evident, it was explained at the time.

"We want our young people to have the best possible start in life – that is why, as part of our plan for education, we want every child to learn a world language,” said Nicky Morgan, who succeeded Gove shortly after program implementation. “It doesn’t just help students to understand different cultures and countries, it opens up the world."

Opening up the world, even for the youngest children, does not seem to be a problem these days, however, with just about every corner of the planet one tap or click away. And while the ability to communicate with people who speak a different language is important — a function likely to be easily facilitated by a future smartphone app — it is not the most important reason that the youngest of students need to learn another language.

“The extra benefits of learning languages indisputably is a way of improving the brain,” Gove said, arguing that, "It is literally the case that learning languages makes you smarter. The neural networks in the brain strengthen as a result of language learning."

<strong>Budget restraints</strong>

In uncertain times, however, with even more uncertain budgets, many schools and school systems are reducing language programs for elementary-age students, too often to the detriment of those most able to benefit from a second (or third) language.

Instruction in world languages at the elementary school level in the U.S., obviously, is not new. Indeed such teaching was done in ancient civilizations and in the schools of America from the 1630s and on. In fact, teaching world languages in elementary schools was relatively widespread in many areas of the United States until World War I, even though the primary purposes of this instruction during those years were to aid in assimilating ethnic immigrant groups into the American way of life.

Fast-forward to today; amidst at best tepid government support for world-languages in schools, still, there has been some progress.

In October of last year, the U.S. Department of Education announced the award of more than $71 million in new and non-competing continuation grants to help strengthen the capacity and performance of American education in world languages, cultural understanding and international studies. The grants fell under the Fulbright-Hays Act, also known as the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961.

“The world is becoming more interconnected than ever before and our programs and grants are helping students to acquire the skills, knowledge and understanding they will need to compete on equal footing for 21st-century careers,” said then-U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. in announcing the grants. “Employers from a cross-section of education, business, and government are expecting our graduates to be able to communicate and collaborate with peers in a global context. The grants help to achieve exactly that, by providing teachers, students and our communities with the opportunities and resources for ensuring our nation’s capacity for global competitiveness.”

At the state level, however, despite a little help from Washington, budget restraints have caused many public districts — and even a number of independent schools — to curtail language instruction. And when it comes to offering world language to the youngest children, some districts offer no language exposure at all.

This wide spectrum of world language programs is a national phenomenon that is manifested at the state level, said Ruta Couet, a world language specialist at the South Carolina Department of Education. “Out of 634 public elementary schools in South Carolina, 115 offer some form of language instruction. Of those 115, only 13 offer daily language instruction, according to the state education department.

"There are many reasons for this," Couet said of the disparity, "ranging from funding, staffing, to a host of different goals for early language programs or no clearly articulated goals at all."

Some local districts say that in the age of accountability for the core subjects, and with ever-changing curriculum mandates, offering world language is not a priority, or they just simply don't have time to fit it into the school day.

<strong>Committed to world language</strong>

For administrators at The Grosse Pointe Academy, teaching a world language to its students, including its youngest in pre-kindergarten, has never been more important, and fitting it into the school day has never been a problem.

“Offering a world language at a young age is of critical importance for our program offering,” said Jennifer Kendall, assistant head of school for early school education and admissions. “It allows children to understand very early that there are other languages spoken by people who share their world, which is what they are just starting to discover through their work in geography and map development. Their brains are open for all that they are exposed to in the classroom. The education of the whole child, a philosophy of learning that exists from our Montessori Early School through grade 8 at the Academy, includes the learning of a world language in addition to art, creative movement, music and physical education.”

The world language program is not a new development either at the Academy.

According to Molly McDermott, who served many years as GPA’s admissions director, language arts played a big part of the school’s curriculum from day one.

“French has been taught in the Early School since the Academy’s very beginning,” she said. “And before that, French was taught when it was a Sacred Heart school from early school through grade 12, primarily because the Religious of the Sacred Heart were of French origin. So when the school opened in 1969 as The Grosse Pointe Academy, it kept some of the traditions of the nuns, which is why we have the French program that exists today. We then eventually began offering Spanish and Mandarin Chinese.”

Kendall said the school’s commitment to teaching world language to its youngest students has never been stronger.

“Introducing a world language at an early age, starting at 2-1/2 years old in our early school, is very natural for children,” she said. “As they continue to learn the English language, they are just as excited to learn French. While it is taught in a fun way, the children learn to count, learn their numbers as well as the names of their family members in French. They especially enjoy practicing each word with a French accent.”

Kendall added that each child in the Early School program progresses in language arts at his or her own rate.

[caption id="attachment_27639" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/leslie2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27639"><img class="wp-image-27639 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/leslie2_1000px.jpg" alt="leslie2_1000px" width="1000" height="618" /></a> World language instructor Claudia Leslie said that exploring the world through language is a vital part of how she approaches teaching the younger students at GPA and adds that class size is critical in that approach.[/caption]

“Preparation for learning the language begins indirectly with daily readings to the class and more directly through activities that make the student aware of the sounds in words,” she said. “Letters of the alphabet are introduced phonetically and once a child has mastered a number of sounds, the moveable alphabet is introduced for spelling phonetic words. This process continues until our Montessori directresses recognize readiness for the actual decoding of words.”

Kendall said there also are supplemental materials for developing language skills for the school’s youngest students.

“Each classroom has a selection of pre-language materials, pre-primers, beginning and more advanced reading books,” she said.

<strong>Small class size key</strong>

Claudia Leslie, who has been the Academy’s Early School through grade 5 French instructor for more than 11 years, said that exploring the world through language is a vital part of how she approaches teaching the younger students at GPA and adds that class size is so critical in that approach.

“The small class sizes at the Academy allow me to nurture the potential of each child, which also allows the students to more quickly discover their unique strengths and passions,” she said. “I make sure that each student gets plenty of opportunities to speak French during the class. I truly believe that giving a child the opportunity to learn a language at an early age is a great advantage because they acquire it in such a natural manner. In addition, I think our language program provides the kids with a deeper understanding of one’s own native language as well as a broader global awareness.”

All students at the Academy continue with their French instruction until they finish the 4th grade. Then, beginning in the 5th grade, students decide between continuing on with French or moving to Spanish as a single language with the intent to follow their language into middle school, where Mandarin Chinese also is presented as an option.

Kendall noted that most of the school’s graduates typically enter French 2 or Spanish 2 upon getting into high school.

“Their super strong base in French has even propelled a number of students to enter French 3 in their freshman year of high school,” she said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Academy kicks off special Action Auction 50 Arbor Day Celebration with a ceremonial tree-planting.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_28004" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/event2_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28004"><img class="wp-image-28004 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/event2_1000px.jpg" alt="event2_1000px" width="1000" height="573" /></a> Academy Head of School Tommy Adams addresses students, parents, faculty, staff and friends at GPA's Arbor Day celebration on April 28.[/caption]

In a new twist to an established annual fund-raising campaign, The Grosse Pointe Academy — a coed, preK-8 independent day school located in Grosse Pointe Farms —  commemorated its <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/support-gpa/action-auction/" target="_blank">50th-annual Action Auction</a></strong> with the "Action Auction 50 Arbor Day Celebration,” an event designed to call attention to the planting of one tree on school grounds for every auction sponsor at the $5,000 threshold or above.

“Our beautiful school is situated on a historic 20-acre campus,” said Kristen Van Pelt, the Academy’s director of development. “With century-old architecture, the facility is a striking sight: a majestic property set amongst lush and diverse trees that have been a huge part of the school’s history.”

Now, in this effort to help the environment, add to the school’s landscape and boost its biggest fundraising event, Academy officials hosted a tree-planting on Arbor Day, which this year occurred on April 28. In addition to the tree-planting, the event included the recognition of the more than 30 sponsors to date who have donated $5,000 or more to the auction for the project.

<strong>A tree-lined history </strong>

Founded in 1885 as an all-girls school by the Society of the Sacred Heart, an order of cloistered nuns, the lakefront property on which the Academy sits was also a self-sustaining farm for more than 50 years. With an abundance of apple, pear and cherry trees as well as grape arbors and raspberry bushes, the nuns and students dined on seasonal fruits, applesauce, jams, jellies and other condiments made from their annual harvests.

“Over the years, however, the landscape of the site has changed,” Van Pelt said. “A significant number of trees have come down due to storms, lightning strikes and age. Trees hold a special place in the hearts of our community. They capture the imagination of both young and old and link us to our past as well as remind us that although much has changed in the last century, these noble trees provide permanence and ultimately a sense of comfort.”

[caption id="attachment_27823" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<img class="wp-image-27823 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_3042-edit_1000px.jpg" alt="img_3042-edit_1000px" width="1000" height="750" /> The Grosse Pointe Academy's 50th annual auction will be held May 13, 2017, beginning at 6 p.m. in the school's Tracy Fieldhouse. Academy officials hosted a tree-planting on Arbor Day, which this year was Friday, April 28.[/caption]

Another part of the school’s arbor history recalled by GPA administrators is a story that has been passed down through generations of Grosse Pointers.

Two rows of silver maples, many of which are still standing, were planted on either side of a pathway that began at the oldest building on the campus and extended west along Kenwood Road. “The Sacred Heart nuns would take leisurely walks through this path as a respite during sunny afternoons,” Van Pelt said. “No one really knows the precise date when the trees were planted, but it was likely done around the turn of the century.”

This means the silver maples are more than 110 years old and will likely reach their maximum life expectancy within the next two decades.

“The arbor project is an extraordinary opportunity for friends of The Grosse Pointe Academy to play a part of the school’s tree conservation, as well as a wonderful way to secure their place in its history,” Van Pelt said. “We look at this project as a total win-win not only for the school but for its generous supporters.”

Many of the silver maple trees that lined the path back then continue to thrive today on GPA's campus.[/caption]

A significant component of this year’s <strong><a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com" target="_blank">50th Anniversary Action Auction</a></strong>, which will be held Saturday, May 13, on The Grosse Pointe Academy campus, is the special ‘paddle-raise’ appeal dedicated to the preservation of campus buildings and grounds. Beginning with this year’s event, auction officials will be calling the appeal “Make It Happen.”

Members of the Grosse Pointe Academy community are encouraged by school officials each year at the auction to take an active role "as guardians of the foundations laid more than a hundred years ago" for the Academy.

This year, the “Make it Happen” paddle-raise will benefit the school’s Tracy Fieldhouse, which is profiled below.

<hr />

<strong>The</strong> <strong>Tracy Fieldhouse</strong>

The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Tracy Fieldhouse, donated by the Emmet Tracy family in 1990, is one of the most important spaces on GPA’s beautiful campus. It’s a place where children compete, perform and play throughout the school year.

[caption id="attachment_27926" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tommy_SOS_350px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27926"><img class="wp-image-27926 size-medium" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tommy_SOS_350px-300x245.jpg" alt="tommy_sos_350px" width="300" height="245" /></a> Head of School Tommy Adams gave the state of the school address in the Tracy Fieldhouse on January 31, 2017.[/caption]

In many ways, this facility is the center of the Academy. It is a place that embodies the school mission: a place where children are nurtured, inspired and challenged. Not only do GPA students learn about physical education, sportsmanship and teamwork here, but they also learn how to create with their bodies, minds and voices, while gaining appreciation for the arts.

The fieldhouse is home to Academy athletes and actors, its players and performers, all of whom have given the community countless opportunities to cheer their triumphs. In addition to sports and class performances, the GPA community gathers in this space for special events. In the fall, grandparents and special friends watch the children sing and shine. In the winter, the community is welcomed to listen to a world-renowned speaker as part of the McMillan lecture series, and we celebrate the holidays with the annual Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony.

In late spring, parents, grandparents, staff and alumni gather for the last time during the school year to recognize the accomplishments of the school’s latest graduates, who leave the fieldhouse ready to make their marks on the world. And of course, one of the most important events held in this room is the one celebrated May 13 – the Action Auction – an evening where the Academy’s closest friends and supporters gather to support this very important place in this very important space.

The Tracy Fieldhouse has provided The Grosse Pointe Academy with so much and has given so many opportunities to its students. School officials want to see that continue, but as time will often do, it has taken a toll on the facility. The much-beloved sports and event space requires many much-needed improvements, including a new floor and more efficient, updated lighting. These updates will only serve to enhance the school’s program and contribute to an already excellent education.

On May 13, at the 50th anniversary of the school's <strong><a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com" target="_blank">Action Auction</a></strong>, please raise your paddle to support improvements and enhancements for the Tracy Fieldhouse — where the Academy’s children learn and grow all year long.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Professional auctioneer tabbed for the Academy’s upcoming May 13 Action Auction says he’s looking forward to working at the country’s ‘grand dame’ of learning.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27945" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/M-Schroeder-large_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27945"><img class="wp-image-27945 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/M-Schroeder-large_1000px.jpg" alt="m-schroeder-large_1000px" width="1000" height="482" /></a> Auctioneer Mark Schroeder has helped raise more than $100 million for nonprofits and learning institutions located throughout the United States.[/caption]

Mark Schroeder has helped raise more than $100 million for nonprofits and learning institutions located throughout the United States. He’s a professional auctioneer and his travels next month will bring him to The Grosse Pointe Academy to help raise much-needed funds during the school’s <a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com" target="_blank"><strong>50th Anniversary Action Auction on May 13</strong></a>.

Proceeds from the annual Action Auction enrich academic offerings, raise scholarship money and tuition assistance funds to benefit students and to support the preservation of the Academy’s historic campus.

Even though he’s based in not-too-far-away Cleveland, it will be the first time Schroeder has worked an auction in the greater Detroit area, although he’s worked a few events a bit north of the Pointes.

“One of them was for a long-time client of mine that is really an incredible organization,” he said. “The Child Abuse and Neglect Council Great Lakes Bay Region, or the CAN Council, does great work in that area of the state.”

[caption id="attachment_27944" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/M-Schroeder-small_300px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27944"><img class="wp-image-27944 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/M-Schroeder-small_300px.jpg" alt="m-schroeder-small_300px" width="300" height="514" /></a> Schroeder said The Grosse Pointe Academy ". . .truly stands as the ‘grand dame’ of learning. . ." in the U.S.[/caption]

Schroeder, who is looking forward to a great gig at the Academy’s auction, said that while it’s his first job with the school, he is well aware of its reputation and status and has more than a few connections to both the school and the Grosse Pointes.

“One of my college roommates at John Carroll University was a Grosse Pointe Farms native,” he said. “And I believe his father was, and could possibly still be, Bob Seger’s accountant. I also think he was a GPA grad. In addition, another John Carroll classmate of mine, Mary Alice Mecke, is currently a parent at GPA and a member of the auction committee. As a John Carroll University alum, I have a number of great friends from the Grosse Pointe area. The Pointes have always sent outstanding young men and women to JCU — and they still do.”

As a certified auctioneer, Schroeder holds a CAI designation, which means he’s one of less that 1 percent of all licensed auctioneers in North America who have been accredited by the Certified Auctioneers Institute. He’s also one of the first auctioneers in the country to earn the Benefit Auctioneer Specialist certification, reflecting a fairly elevated status and expertise in the auction industry.

<strong>From TV to an auction podium</strong>

A graduate of the aforementioned John Carroll University, the Reppert School of Auctioneering and the Hondros College of Business, Schroeder is a 31-time Emmy nominated sports anchor and reporter. He’s won four Emmys and a Telly Award with WJW-TV, a Fox-affiliated television station located in Cleveland, and has earned more accolades with the CBS network and SportsTime Ohio. Plus, he’s accumulated multiple awards from the Associated Press and Cleveland Press Club.

But — we wanted to know — with all of that broadcasting expertise, why get into auctioneering for nonprofits and charity events? Surely it must be more than having the ability to talk fast. . .

“When I was a television producer and reporter, our TV station, WJW-TV, believed in human-interest stories,” he said. “I was fascinated by those stories of people’s lives and the impact those pieces made in their community, our city and beyond. Working in TV, I had lots of opportunities to be the master of ceremonies for many nonprofit galas way before I became a licensed professional benefit auctioneer.”

He said that after doing so many of those benefit auctions, it just seemed natural for him to start his own professional auction business.

“I receive so much satisfaction, not only raising more money for my clients, but seeing the results of that money and how it has helped people — from battling cancer, to housing organ-transplant recipients, to sending hearing and visually impaired kids to an ‘experience camp,’ to scholarship and tuition assistance, to erecting a new science and engineering building for a school. The list is endless.”

<strong>‘Doesn’t get any better’</strong>

He said he is very proud to have been a team member for wonderfully caring organizations and learning institutions that enhance peoples lives and to watch how that investment is manifested in students, for example, who go on to become leaders of our cities, states and country.

“For me, it just doesn’t get any better than being a professional benefit auctioneer!”

Despite such a wide swath of auction experience and success, Schroeder nonetheless is very excited to be a part of the <a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com" target="_blank">GPA family on May 13</a>.

“There is a rich fundraising history at GPA and being part of the team that is celebrating the 50th Anniversary is a very special to me,” he said.

He said he was somewhat aware of the rich history of education at The Grosse Pointe Academy, but wanted to know more. So he asked for and received a thorough tour of the school when he first met with GPA auction officials a few months ago.

“As a former television reporter, I believe in knowing as much as possible about my client or subject and the more I know and understand about them, the better agent I will be for them on the night of the event,” he said. “I’m a Catholic kid with 16 years of Catholic school education — kindergarten through college — so I fully appreciated this landmark, this institution of learning, the gorgeous chapel and the beautiful workmanship of wood on the walls as you walk the halls.

“It truly stands as the ‘Grand Dame’ of learning in our country.”

Schroeder said attending guests at the May 13 auction are in for a great celebration and some surprises.

“My duty that evening is hosting as master of ceremonies in addition to conducting an amazingly procured 30-live auction experience and, most importantly, the ‘paddle-raise,’ which we are now calling, “Make It Happen.”*

*This year’s auction <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/making-it-happen-for-the-tracy-fieldhouse/" target="_blank"><strong>paddle-raise will benefit the school’s Tracy Fieldhouse</strong></a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Rare car to be auctioned by The Grosse Pointe Academy has a history in U.S. presidential politics.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_27967" align="alignleft" width="200"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maurice_200px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27967"><img class="wp-image-27967 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/maurice_200px.jpg" alt="maurice_200px" width="200" height="214" /></a> Maurice "Morry" Taylor has been a generous friend of The Grosse Pointe Academy for many years.[/caption]

When Grosse Pointe Farms resident Maurice “Morry” Taylor’s daughter suggested that he donate his rare 1993 Dodge Viper with its V10 engine to The Grosse Pointe Academy for this year’s <a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com/" target="_blank">50th Anniversary Action Auction</a>, he didn’t hesitate.

“It’s for a great cause,” he said.

The car had been in environmentally controlled storage for years and is in tip-top shape, according to school auction officials. Taylor, 72, noted that the car has only about 16,000 miles on it, most of which were accumulated in Quincy, Illinois, where Taylor’s company, Titan International, a manufacturer of industrial and agricultural wheels and tires, is located.

“The car was used in Quincy for customers to drive, and some of my engineers liked to drive it around town as well because it was so fast,” said Taylor, who with his wife, Michelle, served as Action Auction chairpersons in 1990 and whose three kids and two grandkids attended GPA. “At that time, people actually thought it was the Batmobile!”

<strong>A car is born</strong>

The vaunted Dodge Viper SRT-10 was launched by Chrysler Corporation in 1992 to rave reviews. During its nearly four years in development, although a V8 engine was first used in the test prototype, the V10, which the production car was meant to use, was ready in February 1990. Official approval from then-Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca came in May 1990 and a year later, Carroll Shelby piloted a pre-production car as the pace vehicle in the Indianapolis 500 race. In November 1991, the car was released to reviewers with first retail shipments beginning in January 1992.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/viper-int_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27963"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27963" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/viper-int_1000px.jpg" alt="viper-int_1000px" width="1000" height="604" /></a>

The first run of Vipers was small. In fact, between 1992 and 1993, only 1,043 Vipers were built, and of the 983 designated for sale in the United States, 39 ended up in Canada and 66 found their way to various foreign ports.

In its initial two production years, the Viper was only produced in red and black. In 1992, only one vehicle was produced in black and in 1993, volume was limited to just 115 black units, one of which ended up with Taylor, who noted that the vehicle’s interior and exterior have been professionally detailed to near-perfection. The Viper’s 8-liter V10 gasoline engine produces 400 horsepower, with 462 foot-pounds of torque, giving it performance specs that take it from zero-to-60 in just 4.4 seconds and through a quarter-mile in only 13.

<strong>Roaring into Iowa</strong>

In a recent interview with the Academy, Taylor recalled the time his Dodge Viper played a rather unique role during the 1996 presidential campaign.

Well, actually, both Taylor and the Viper were part of a Republican primary campaign that ultimately sent Senator Bob Dole up against Bill Clinton, who was seeking his second term as U.S. president.

Fed up then with what was going on in Washington, Taylor, who by that time was hugely successful in business, threw his hat in the ring for the Republican nomination for president, vowing to balance the federal budget and cut one-third of government jobs in the process.

“I remember using that Viper during my campaign in 1996,” he said. “I actually drove it straight into Iowa State University’s Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa, during the Iowa Straw Poll and was followed by more than 200 bikers!”

Taylor ultimately dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination that eventually went to Sen. Dole.

The Viper also left presidential politics to serve as Taylor (and Titan’s) “four-wheeled ambassador” in Quincy.

“That car is all raw horsepower,” said Taylor, who currently serves as Titan’s chairman of the board. “That baby was made for the track.”

And, the Academy hopes, that “baby” will be “Taylor-made” for one lucky Action Auction bidder.

In an inspiring ceremony held the evening of April 25 in The Grosse Academy Chapel, 11 middle-school students from the Academy were inducted into the National Junior Honor Society.

Abigail Keane, Elizabeth Kendrick, Bode Neumeister, Caroline Peabody, Alexandra Rollins, Ava Said, Lorna Savage, Jacob Tomlinson, Olivia Valente, Kennedy Waller and Kelsey Williams were honored Tuesday as new NJHS members.

Membership in the NJHS is one of the highest honors that can be awarded to a middle-school student. Chapters in more than 5,000 middle schools across the U.S. endeavor to give practical meaning to the goals of scholarship, leadership, service, citizenship and character.

Today, it is estimated that more than one million students participate in official Honor Society activities. NHS and NJHS chapters are found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, many U.S. territories, and Canada. Chapter membership not only recognizes students for their accomplishments, but challenges them to develop further through active involvement in school activities and community service.

It’s been a flurry of activity at auction central at The Grosse Pointe Academy as volunteers, auction chairs and school officials are preparing for the 50th GPA Action Auction, which will begin at 6 p.m., Saturday evening on the Academy’s Grosse Pointe Farms campus.

According to Kristen Van Pelt, GPA’s director of development, the annual event does not happen without a lot of help, including help from faculty and staff.

“We are so thankful for the help of our teachers and staff who are called upon once again in an effort to make the evening run successfully,” she said. “The money raised goes into the school’s operating budget, affording our staff the opportunity to continue to teach our students and provide a program that consistently rates among the highest in southeast Michigan.”

The silent auction opened Wednesday of this week and items for both the silent and live auctions are being set in place in the Academy’s Tracy Fieldhouse. Featured auction items available include a <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/a-viper-the-academy-and-a-presidential-candidate/" target="_blank"><strong>rare 1993 Dodge Viper</strong></a>, an original <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/academy-steps-to-star-in-upcoming-auction/" target="_blank"><strong>oil painting by alum and noted artist Meg Mercier (’77)</strong></a>, and a <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/an-aquamarine-and-the-auction/" target="_blank"><strong>special ring with a 10.17-carat aquamarine stone</strong></a> designed by local jeweler Edmund T. Ahee to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the auction.

The evening will wrap up with the Club Action Auction Afterglow, always a fun time of music and dancing.

Van Pelt also noted that famed charity auctioneer <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/fast-talking-fundraiser-and-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Mark Schroeder</strong> </a>of Auction Brio will be on hand for the big event, bringing an exciting new wrinkle to the actual auction process.

Over four decades, the GPA auction has generated more than $15.2 million dollars in net proceeds from an event that regularly features more than 400 attendees.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/auction-photo3_1000px-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28040"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28040" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/auction-photo3_1000px-1.jpg" alt="auction-photo3_1000px" width="1000" height="598" /></a>

Another significant component of this year’s 50th Anniversary Action Auction is the special ‘paddle-raise’ appeal dedicated to the preservation of campus buildings and grounds. Beginning with this year’s event, auction officials will be calling the appeal “Make It Happen,” and Saturday's “Make it Happen” will benefit the school’s Tracy Fieldhouse.

Also significant each auction is the <a href="http://gpa.preclickbid.com/raffle/" target="_blank"><strong>raffle</strong></a>, which this year features a 100-ticket-maximum, $100-per-ticket chance to win a “season of shoes and handbags” presented by Neiman Marcus. It’s an exclusive opportunity to shop at Neiman Marcus once a month for three months for the latest in designer shoes and handbags. Tickets will be sold for $100 each during the silent auction from 6 to 8 p.m. on Saturday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Second time’s the charm: latest McMillan speaker looks forward to Monday’s rescheduled event.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lahey-doorway_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28088"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28088" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lahey-doorway_1000px.jpg" alt="lahey-doorway_1000px" width="1000" height="668" /></a>

Jessica Lahey will be visiting The Grosse Pointe Academy this coming Monday, May 22. It’s actually her second visit to the Academy because this award-winning author and educator’s first visit in early November of last year was interrupted by a power failure caused by a traffic accident involving a gravel hauler that brought down multiple power lines nearby at Fisher Road and Grosse Pointe Boulevard.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/book_CVR_815px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28098"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-28098" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/book_CVR_815px-233x300.jpg" alt="book_cvr_815px" width="233" height="300" /></a>Lahey was originally scheduled November 7 as the speaker for the 2016 edition of the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series. But because electrical power at the Academy and the surrounding neighborhood was out due to the accident and with no estimate of restoration by DTE, Lahey and school officials decided to postpone and reschedule for this Monday at 7 p.m.

“I am so looking forward to visiting again,” Lahey said. “I actually had a great time sitting in the dark last November, talking to people about the highlights of what I WOULD have said on stage. I found out that a number of people had driven a long way to get there that evening!”

In Monday’s event designed primarily for parents (and grandparents) of school-age children, Lahey, who is the author of the New York Times bestselling book, “The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed,” will offer parents, teachers, administrators, and guidance counselors practical advice for fostering intrinsic motivation and weaning kids off of extrinsic motivators such as short-term rewards, bribes, honors, coercion, and yes, even grades, while giving kids the support and encouragement they need in order to succeed.

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lahey-new_feature_600px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28090"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-28090" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/lahey-new_feature_600px-300x184.jpg" alt="lahey-new_feature_600px" width="300" height="184" /></a>Lacey said that she still is on the road a lot speaking at schools and other institutions about her book and about her years of teaching elementary- and middle-school students.

“I am currently actively touring to support the book,” she said. “I’m actually booked through the end of the year and I’m also working on developing my next project —  something I will keep to myself for now.”

When she is not out on the speaking circuit or writing books, Lahey is busy as an English and writing teacher, correspondent for The Atlantic, commentator for Vermont Public Radio, and writes the “Parent-Teacher Conference” column for the New York Times. She earned a B.A. in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and a J.D. with a concentration in juvenile and education law from the University of North Carolina School of Law. She lives in New Hampshire with her husband and two sons.

Lahey adds that she’s got a pretty good idea of what’s next for her in terms of a new book, but “as my editor has not even seen the new proposal yet, I am keeping it quiet!”

She did say, however, say that an essay she wrote just came out today in “Creative Nonfiction” magazine (available <strong><a href="https://www.creativenonfiction.org/online-reading/i%E2%80%99ve-taught-monsters" target="_blank">here</a>).</strong>

More on Lahey, including another interview she gave to the Academy late last year, is available <strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/speaker-announced-for-2016-mcmillan-lecture-at-the-grosse-pointe-academy/" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.

<strong>About the William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series</strong>
William Charles McMillan III was a student at The Grosse Pointe Academy from 1973 until 1981 where, receiving love and encouragement, he learned to reach beyond his limitations. Although weak physically, McMillan was intellectually gifted and his passion for life, his love and concern for all living things, and his enthusiastic use of verbal skills changed the lives of those who were closest to him and left a lasting impression on all with whom he came in contact. Never at a loss for words, McMillan was bursting with impressions, questions and insights which came pouring out in a dazzling, dizzying torrent. It was rare to have a brief, superficial conversation with McMillan. A friend commented, “I sometimes felt like I needed a seat belt when William was talking to me, because he would take us into outer space, back into primeval history, and then into a universe of his own imagining.

"McMillan believed that anyone could make a significant and lasting impact on the world no matter what one’s age, size or circumstance."

The William Charles McMillan III Lecture Series focuses on elementary education and is dedicated to the proposition that every child can reach beyond his or her own limitation, that each child makes the world a better place. It is the goal of these lectures to take your mind where it has never been before.

The Grosse Pointe Academy, southeast Michigan’s premier independent pre-K through 8 school, announced two key appointments today.

Jennifer Kendall, currently assistant head of school for early school education and admissions, will become the school’s assistant head of school for early and lower school education and director of curriculum beginning with the 2017-18 school year.

Didi DeBoer, who has served most recently as a grade-4 teacher and lead teacher for both the intermediate and lower schools at the Academy, has been named assistant head of school for grades 4-8, also effective beginning with the new school year.

In her new position, Kendall will be responsible for managing the operations of both the early and lower schools at GPA and will focus additional efforts on the scope and sequence of the Academy’s entire academic program.

Tommy Adams, GPA’s head of school, said Kendall will no doubt be a great benefit to the school due to her strong experience and expertise in curriculum design and teaching models.

“While she will assume this role beginning July 1st, Jen will continue to play an important role in the programmatic initiatives on which we are currently working,” Adams added. “And I am extremely grateful for all of Jen's good work with overseeing and managing the admission process over the past several years.”

Kendall first came to GPA in 2008 as principal of the early and lower school. Prior to the Academy, she served in successive roles as district technology coordinator, supervisor of instruction, director of curriculum, and elementary principal in the Midland Park School District in Midland Park, New Jersey. She holds a Master of Education degree from Columbia University, Master of Arts degree from Caldwell College and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mount Holyoke College.

DeBoer’s new responsibilities include oversight of grades 4-8 as well as the forthcoming programmatic changes proposed for the upcoming school year and beyond, including the new direction of the math curriculum. (<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/academy-restructures-math-curriculum-and-sets-new-class-schedule/" target="_blank"><strong>More info here.</strong></a>)

“We know that many parents will be disappointed to see Didi leave the classroom, but we are confident that with her help and guidance we will find a terrific 4th-grade teaching candidate to succeed her,” Adams said. “I am impressed with Didi's desire to become a strong leader and mentor as well as her commitment to want to make GPA the best it can be. I believe that her strong work ethic and earnest nature will be of great benefit to not only our students and faculty in grades 4-8, but to the entire school.”

DeBoer’s major in college was math and science and she also holds Master of Education degree. Prior to coming to GPA seven years ago, DeBoer taught in Warren and Mt. Clemens, and was a long-term substitute teacher in the Grosse Pointe Public School System.

Both Kendall and DeBoer officially begin their new positions on July 1, 2017.

<strong>New math program imported from Singapore to take students ‘beyond the test.’</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/M-Roberts_BD4A5003_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28117"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28117" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/M-Roberts_BD4A5003_1000px.jpg" alt="m-roberts_bd4a5003_1000px" width="1000" height="1137" /></a>

The country of Singapore was among the top-ranked countries in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 for math performance in school-age children, according to the “Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.” Further, the “Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016,” from the World Economic Forum, placed Singapore first out of 140 countries in the quality of math and science education.

The methods of math that prevail in Singapore and which are behind such success have now gone ‘international,’ as more than 25 other countries worldwide, including the U.S., have imported the “Singapore math” in many of their more innovative schools and school systems.

Administrators at The Grosse Pointe Academy recently announced that beginning with the 2017-18 year, the school will begin to integrate Singapore math into its lower school-through-middle school curriculum. In addition, beginning with the 2017-18 school year, the implementation of a new class schedule will provide significantly more class time and learning depth to core subject areas such as math and English while still supporting the whole child concept of education long embraced by the Academy.

For Didi DeBoer, who will be the Academy’s new assistant head of school for grades 4-8 on July 1, the new direction in math is exciting and timely.

“Singapore math will be both rigorous and enriching,” said DeBoer, who has served as a lead teacher for both the intermediate and lower schools over the past several years. “It will provide our students with a mastery-level mathematical foundation, and give our students the academic advantage to achieve at the highest level. This program most definitely strengthens a student's ability to problem-solve, while creating a culture-of-growth mindset that will lead our students to lasting learning ‘beyond the test.’”

<strong>What is it?</strong>

The result of a complete restructuring by Singaporean education authorities of math curricula in that country during the 1980s, math education at the elementary level in its schools moved quickly away from rote learning toward a much deeper understanding of math concepts that then led to a surprisingly rapid improvement in student math performance pretty much across the education spectrum in this Southeast Asian nation.

Jennifer Kendall, who will become the Academy’s assistant head of school for early and lower school education and the director of curriculum on July 1, said the inherent ability of the new math program to strengthen number sense, core math facts, and problem-solving will be a big benefit for all GPA students regardless of grade.

While Singapore math originated in Singapore, the term “Singapore math” was actually coined in the United States to help describe this new approach of learning and mastering fewer concepts, but at greater detail. This is accomplished, said DeBoer, by having students use a basic three-step learning process, which typically is defined by concrete, pictorial and abstract steps.

In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences using concrete objects such as blocks, dice or paper clips. This is followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts. Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers and symbols.

DeBoer added that even though it may sound counter-intuitive, the Academy is switching to Singapore math from “Everyday math” to offer a more traditional approach to teaching mathematics. “It’s more rigorous than our current math curriculum,” she said. “Also, we can focus on the mastery of concepts that Singapore math provides so that we are not teaching a ‘mile wide and an inch deep,’ but rather our students will be getting a much deeper understanding of math.”

<strong>Still another reason ‘GPA is unique’</strong>

DeBoer, who most recently was a 4th-grade teacher and co-coordinator of the Academy’s STEAM and garden classroom, has been on staff at the school for seven years. She said the new math curriculum is still another example of how the school is always moving forward with program enhancements.

“The Academy has really changed in the seven years I’ve been here,” she said. “We have become a school that is not only on the forefront, technologically, which is amazing, but is moving much further than our peers in our core academics. Also, our focus on STEAM education is a tremendously positive change that I have enjoyed being a part of. Our garden classroom has been such a welcome addition as well. It has really opened up our learning opportunities and is one more reason out of many that GPA is unique and special.”

School head Tommy Adams said that the upcoming changes are designed to provide the best educational foundation for children during the most formative years of their lives.

“Our goal must be to prepare each student for the challenges of high school and beyond by ensuring that the knowledge they acquire is pertinent and prepares them for life success,” he said. “We want our students to actively connect the knowledge they acquire to life and to discover a curiosity for learning and thinking. The programmatic changes that will be implemented for the upcoming school year and beyond will direct attention to the core aspects of our mission, bring clarity to institutional goals, and strengthen our ability to support the <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/the-portrait-of-a-grosse-pointe-academy-graduate/" target="_blank"><strong>portrait of a Grosse Pointe Academy graduate</strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/the-portrait-of-a-grosse-pointe-academy-graduate/" target="_blank">.</a>”</strong>

As we begin another successful year of Montessori education at The Grosse Pointe Academy — today was the Academy Early School’s first day of the 2017-18 school year — we are pleased to offer four quotes (plus one bonus) from the founder of one of the world’s most innovative education philosophies, Maria Montessori.

NOTE: The Grosse Pointe Academy is home to the state of Michigan’s longest continuous-running Montessori program.

“The child is capable of developing and giving us tangible proof of the possibility of a better humanity. He or she has shown us the true process of construction of the human being. We have seen children totally change as they acquire a love for things and as their sense of order, discipline, and self-control develops within them.... The child is both a hope and a promise for mankind.” <strong>(From Maria Montessori’s “Education and Peace,” first published in 1949)</strong>

"Thus it happens that at the age of three, life seems to begin again; for now consciousness shines forth in all its fullness and glory. Between these two periods, the unconscious period and the one that follows it of conscious development, there seems to be a well-marked boundary." <strong>(From Maria Montessori’s “The Absorbent Mind,” first published in 1949)</strong>

"The little child’s first movements were instinctive. Now, he or she acts consciously and voluntarily, and with this comes an awakening of his spirit…. Conscious will is a power that develops with use and activity. We must aim at cultivating the will…. Its development is a slow process that evolves through a continuous activity in relationship with the environment." <strong>(From “The Absorbent Mind”)</strong>

"The child has to acquire physical independence by being self-sufficient; he must become of independent will be using in freedom his own power of choice; he must become capable of independent thought by working alone without interruption. The child’s development follows a path of successive stages of independence." <strong>(From “The Absorbent Mind”)</strong>

"So, from the age of three till six, being able to now tackle their environment deliberately and consciously, they begin a period of real constructiveness." <strong>(From “The Absorbent Mind”)</strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The Academy’s continuum of learning awaits the Early School Class of 2017.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BD4A7661-1_edit_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28163"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28163" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BD4A7661-1_edit_1000px.jpg" alt="bd4a7661-1_edit_1000px" width="1000" height="667" /></a>

On June 9, members of The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Early School Montessori kindergarten class celebrated their graduation, which means many likely will matriculate to the Academy’s Lower School in the fall.

The continuum of learning, which began for the young students in GPA’s Early School, will now flourish for them in Grades 1-3. Each child is exposed to strong academics in a traditional classroom setting, supported by an array of opportunities for self-expression through music, art, creative movement and physical education.

Beginning in the Lower School, children at the Academy are taught the following disciplines: language arts (including writing, literature, spelling, vocabulary and grammar), mathematics, science, environmental science, social studies, technology, French, music, art, creative movement, physical education and Christian Life. Technology is used as a tool to enhance the learning environment.

In the Lower School classrooms, teachers employ multi-texts and design programs in which each student can progress at his or her own level. In addition, a learning-resource specialist is available to provide reinforcement or enrichment to match individual needs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>GPA's newest graduates will be attending some of the finest secondary schools in the country, including Salisbury School, Mercersburg Academy, Renaissance, University Liggett, Cranbrook, Mercy and UD Jesuit.</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grads_gpa_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28170"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28170" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/grads_gpa_1000px.jpg" alt="grads_gpa_1000px" width="1000" height="606" /></a>

The Grosse Pointe Academy graduated the Class of 2107 tonight in a ceremony steeped in decades of tradition. It also was a special evening that reflected a real sense of excitement that these young men and women no doubt are feeling about the future that lies ahead.

Without question, this year’s talented class of 19 students, who will be attending some of the finest high schools in the country — including Salisbury School, Mercersburg Academy, Renaissance, University Liggett, Cranbrook, Mercy and UD Jesuit — are leaving 171 Lake Shore Road and heading to that future with an advantage — an advantage that comes from experiencing at least eight years of the best “uncommon” education available in Michigan.

Congratulations to <strong>The Grosse Pointe Academy’s Class of 2017:</strong>

<strong>Gordon Acheson, Elizabeth Becker, Alexandria Belyue, Christian Buhl, Alessandro Cavataio, Emmanuelle Cubba, Margaret Demkowicz, Prosperity Dickerson, Jack Fauster, Kaitlyn Gray, Julia Hartnett, Christian Hopkins, Angel Jones, Alexander Kelly, Elizabeth Kendrick, Courtney Mecke, May Savage, Thomas Smith and Christina Thomas.</strong>

[caption id="attachment_28187" align="aligncenter" width="1000"]<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/christian-siblings_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28187"><img class="wp-image-28187 size-full" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/christian-siblings_1000px.jpg" alt="christian-siblings_1000px" width="1000" height="642" /></a> 2017 Academy graduate Christian Buhl, second from left, is with siblings Elise, Jeffrey and William, all of whom also graduated from GPA.[/caption]

The Buhl family goes way back with The Grosse Pointe Academy. In fact, when Christian Buhl graduated from GPA this past Tuesday, he was wrapping up a history that included numerous family members who also studied in the classrooms and walked the grounds of this venerable campus on 171 Lake Shore Road.

Christian’s mom and dad attended GPA and both his maternal and paternal grandmothers graduated when the school was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart. More recently, Christian’s two older brothers, Jeffrey and William, graduated GPA in 2013 and his sister, Elise, was in the Class of 2015.

“The Academy has a long history in our family and holds a very special place in our hearts,” said Christian’s mother, Lindsey, who graduated with her husband, Tom, from GPA in 1982. “When Tom and I moved back to Grosse Pointe years ago, there was no question that our children would attend GPA

She said it has been an amazing experience for all their children.

“And now with two heading off to college and two in high school, I can honestly say that GPA gave all of them the foundation necessary to be successful,” she added. “I know there are many wonderful schools in our community, but there is just a feeling you get when you walk into the school. It's truly a sense of community and such a safe place for children to grow and learn.”

For Christian, who will be attending Salisbury School in northwest Connecticut in the fall, he said he agrees with his mother 100 percent. His time at GPA was very special to him, including and especially the Early School.

“I loved Mrs. Beth at the Early School,” he said. “I actually loved everything about Montessori. Who doesn’t like to build that pink tower or wash their hands in the special bowls. In fact, I think most of my kindergarten friends have been with me until my last day of eighth grade.”

Christian will be taking more than his pink-tower experience to Salisbury, however. “I think the Academy has done a great job in preparing me for high school,” he said. “I feel that I will be more than competitive in math, reading and science. But above all else, I have made friends that I know will last a lifetime.”

He also said that the encouragement from GPA to serve in the community was a big part of his education and experience at the school.

“We were required to do 10 hours of community service during each year of middle school,” he said. “At first, I thought it would be a boring task, but in seventh grade we went to St. Paul next door and helped the homeless. This made a huge impact on me. I didn’t realize that there were so many people in need right in our own community. I hope in the future to be able to give back as much as I can.”

Athletics also played a large part in Christian’s time at GPA. “I played lacrosse, basketball and soccer at GPA and hope to play those sports at Salisbury as well in addition to possibly rowing and squash.”

While boarding school will certainly be a big change of pace for him, he’s looking forward to it.

“Some of my friends go to boarding school and they said they really like it. So I wanted to give it a try as something different and new. Actually the second I finished my tour of Salisbury on my official visit, I knew it was the place for me!”

<strong>New math program imported from Singapore to take students ‘beyond the test’</strong>

<a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/M-Roberts_BD4A5003_1000px.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-28117"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28117" src="http://www.gpacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/M-Roberts_BD4A5003_1000px.jpg" alt="m-roberts_bd4a5003_1000px" width="1000" height="1137" /></a>

The country of Singapore was among the top-ranked countries in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 for math performance in school-age children, according to the “Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study.” Further, the “Global Competitiveness Report 2015-2016,” from the World Economic Forum, placed Singapore first out of 140 countries in the quality of math and science education.

The methods of math that prevail in Singapore and which are behind such success have now gone ‘international,’ as more than 25 other countries worldwide, including the U.S., have imported the “Singapore math” in many of their more innovative schools and school systems.

The 2017-18 school year brings the introduction of Singapore math to The Grosse Pointe Academy's lower school-through-middle school curriculum. The implementation of a new class schedule, too, will provide significantly more class time and learning depth to core subject areas such as math and English while still supporting the whole child concept of education long embraced by the Academy.

For Didi DeBoer, who is the Academy’s new assistant head of school for grades 4-8, the new direction in math is exciting and timely.

“Singapore math will be both rigorous and enriching,” said DeBoer, who has served as a lead teacher for both the intermediate and lower schools over the past several years. “It will provide our students with a mastery-level mathematical foundation, and give our students the academic advantage to achieve at the highest level. This program most definitely strengthens a student's ability to problem-solve, while creating a culture-of-growth mindset that will lead our students to lasting learning ‘beyond the test.’”

<strong>What is it?</strong>

The result of a complete restructuring by Singaporean education authorities of math curricula in that country during the 1980s, math education at the elementary level in its schools moved quickly away from rote learning toward a much deeper understanding of math concepts that then led to a surprisingly rapid improvement in student math performance pretty much across the education spectrum in this Southeast Asian nation.

Jennifer Kendall, the Academy’s assistant head of school for early and lower school education and the director of curriculum, said the inherent ability of the new math program to strengthen number sense, core math facts, and problem-solving will be a big benefit for all GPA students regardless of grade.

While Singapore math originated in Singapore, the term “Singapore math” was actually coined in the United States to help describe this new approach of learning and mastering fewer concepts, but at greater detail. This is accomplished, said DeBoer, by having students use a basic three-step learning process, which typically is defined by concrete, pictorial and abstract steps.

In the concrete step, students engage in hands-on learning experiences using concrete objects such as blocks, dice or paper clips. This is followed by drawing pictorial representations of mathematical concepts. Students then solve mathematical problems in an abstract way by using numbers and symbols.

DeBoer added that even though it may sound counter-intuitive, the Academy is switching to Singapore math from “Everyday math” to offer a more traditional approach to teaching mathematics. “It’s more rigorous than our current math curriculum,” she said. “Also, we can focus on the mastery of concepts that Singapore math provides so that we are not teaching a ‘mile wide and an inch deep,’ but rather our students will be getting a much deeper understanding of math.”

<strong>Still another reason ‘GPA is unique’</strong>

DeBoer, who most recently was a 4th-grade teacher and co-coordinator of the Academy’s STEAM and garden classroom, has been on staff at the school for seven years. She said the new math curriculum is still another example of how the school is always moving forward with program enhancements.

“The Academy has really changed in the seven years I’ve been here,” she said. “We have become a school that is not only on the forefront, technologically, which is amazing, but is moving much further than our peers in our core academics. Also, our focus on STEAM education is a tremendously positive change that I have enjoyed being a part of. Our garden classroom has been such a welcome addition as well. It has really opened up our learning opportunities and is one more reason out of many that GPA is unique and special.”

School head Tommy Adams said that the changes are designed to provide the best educational foundation for children during the most formative years of their lives.

“Our goal must be to prepare each student for the challenges of high school and beyond by ensuring that the knowledge they acquire is pertinent and prepares them for life success,” he said. “We want our students to actively connect the knowledge they acquire to life and to discover a curiosity for learning and thinking. The programmatic changes implemented for this school year and beyond will direct attention to the core aspects of our mission, bring clarity to institutional goals, and strengthen our ability to support the <a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/the-portrait-of-a-grosse-pointe-academy-graduate/" target="_blank"><strong>portrait of a Grosse Pointe Academy graduate</strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.gpacademy.org/news/the-portrait-of-a-grosse-pointe-academy-graduate/" target="_blank">.</a>”</strong>
